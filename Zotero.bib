To ensure optimal decision-making, the weight given to decision outcomes should reflect their salience in predicting future outcomes, and this salience should be modulated by the volatility of the reward environment. We show that human subjects assess volatility in an optimal manner and adjust decision-making accordingly. This optimal estimate of volatility is reflected in the {fMRI} signal in the anterior cingulate cortex ({ACC}) when each trial outcome is observed. When a new piece of information is witnessed, activity levels reflect its salience for predicting future outcomes. Furthermore, variations in this {ACC} signal across the population predict variations in subject learning rates. Our results provide a formal account of how we weigh our different experiences in guiding our future actions.},

	abstract = {The “apparent motion” illusion is evoked when stationary stimuli are successively flashed in spatially separated positions. It depends on the precise spatial and temporal separations of the stimuli. For large spatiotemporal separation, the long-range apparent motion ({lrAM}), it remains unclear how the visual system computes unambiguous motion signals. Here we investigated whether intracortical interactions within retinotopic maps could shape a global motion representation at the level of V1 population in response to a {lrAM}. In fixating monkeys, voltage-sensitive dye imaging revealed the emergence of a spatio-temporal representation of the motion trajectory at the scale of V1 population activity, shaped by systematic backward suppressive waves. We show that these waves are the expected emergent property of a recurrent gain control fed by the horizontal intra-cortical network. Such non-linearities explain away ambiguous correspondence problems of the stimulus along the motion path, preformating V1 population response for an optimal read-out by downstream areas.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10734},
	abstract = {While deep neural networks take loose inspiration from neuroscience, it is an open question how seriously to take the analogies between artiﬁcial deep networks and biological neuronal systems. Interestingly, recent work has shown that deep convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) trained on large-scale image recognition tasks can serve as strikingly good models for predicting the responses of neurons in visual cortex to visual stimuli, suggesting that analogies between artiﬁcial and biological neural networks may be more than superﬁcial. However, while {CNNs} capture key properties of the average responses of cortical neurons, they fail to explain other properties of these neurons. For one, {CNNs} typically require large quantities of labeled input data for training. Our own brains, in contrast, rarely have access to this kind of supervision, so to the extent that representations are similar between {CNNs} and brains, this similarity must arise via different training paths. In addition, neurons in visual cortex produce complex time-varying responses even to static inputs, and they dynamically tune themselves to temporal regularities in the visual environment. We argue that these differences are clues to fundamental differences between the computations performed in the brain and in deep networks. To begin to close the gap, here we study the emergent properties of a previouslydescribed recurrent generative network that is trained to predict future video frames in a self-supervised manner. Remarkably, the model is able to capture a wide variety of seemingly disparate phenomena observed in visual cortex, ranging from single unit response dynamics to complex perceptual motion illusions. These results suggest potentially deep connections between recurrent predictive neural network models and the brain, providing new leads that can enrich both ﬁelds.},

	abstract = {Due to the delays inherent in neuronal transmission, our awareness of sensory events necessarily lags behind the occurrence of those events in the world. If the visual system did not compensate for these delays, we would consistently mislocalize moving objects behind their actual position. Anticipatory mechanisms that might compensate for these delays have been reported in animals, and such mechanisms have also been hypothesized to underlie perceptual effects in humans such as the Flash-Lag Effect. However, to date no direct physiological evidence for anticipatory mechanisms has been found in humans. Here, we apply multivariate pattern classification to time-resolved {EEG} data to investigate anticipatory coding of object position in humans. By comparing the time-course of neural position representation for objects in both random and predictable apparent motion, we isolated anticipatory mechanisms that could compensate for neural delays when motion trajectories were predictable. As well as revealing an early neural position representation (lag 80–90 ms) that was unaffected by the predictability of the object's trajectory, we demonstrate a second neural position representation at 140–150 ms that was distinct from the first, and that was pre-activated ahead of the moving object when it moved on a predictable trajectory. The latency advantage for predictable motion was approximately 16 ± 2 ms. To our knowledge, this provides the first direct experimental neurophysiological evidence of anticipatory coding in human vision, revealing the time-course of predictive mechanisms without using a spatial proxy for time. The results are numerically consistent with earlier animal work, and suggest that current models of spatial predictive coding in visual cortex can be effectively extended into the temporal domain.},

	abstract = {Animals employ a diverse array of colorations to avoid being consumed by predators. While much research has focused on patterns that work when the animal remains stationary, studies examining the role of colour patterns that function when it moves to avoid predation remain scarce. Here, I propose and test the hypothesis that striking colorations that change dynamically through time, for example bright colours on the dorsal wing surface in combination with cryptic/contrasting ventral coloration (or vice versa) as seen in many insects and birds, serve to protect the moving animal from predation. This idea is analogous to a well-known visual illusion termed the flash lag effect which occurs because of the constraints in estimating the instantaneous position of a moving object due to the inherent neural processing delay. I performed a virtual predation experiment using a touch screen where human participants were asked to capture a moving stimulus that changed colour dynamically through time or remained constant. I found stimuli with dynamic colour change were caught less often and less accurately than a colour-static white or background-matching stimulus but were equally difficult to capture as a colour-static average grey under certain conditions. These results suggest that dynamic colour change is effective in lowering the probability of capture, but this benefit is not unique, as the colour-static average grey stimulus had a similar advantage. Overall, the study thus presents the first clear evidence that animals that change colours during movement could gain significant protection against predation, probably by misrepresenting the prey's location.},

We study here the principled construction of a generative model specifically crafted to probe motion perception. In that context, we first provide an axiomatic, biologically-driven derivation of the model. This model synthesizes random dynamic textures which are defined by stationary Gaussian distributions obtained by the random aggregation of warped patterns. Importantly, we show that this model can equivalently be described as a stochastic partial differential equation. Using this characterization of motion in images, it allows us to recast motion-energy models into a principled Bayesian inference framework. Finally, we apply these textures in order to psychophysically probe speed perception in humans.In this framework, while the likelihood is derived from the generative model, the prior is estimated from the observed results and accounts for the perceptual bias in a principled fashion.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex are known for responding vigorously but with high variability to classical stimuli such as drifting bars or gratings. By contrast, natural scenes are encoded more efficiently by sparse and temporal precise spiking responses. We used a conductance-based model of the visual system in higher mammals to investigate how two specific features of the thalamo-cortical pathway, namely push-pull receptive field organization and synaptic depression, can contribute to this contextual reshaping of V1 responses. By comparing cortical dynamics evoked respectively by natural vs. artificial stimuli in a comprehensive parametric space analysis, we demonstrate that the reliability and sparseness of the spiking responses during natural vision is not a mere consequence of the increased bandwidth in the sensory input spectrum. Rather, it results from the combined impacts of synaptic depression and push-pull inhibition, the later acting for natural scenes as a form of “effective” feed-forward inhibition as demonstrated in other sensory systems. Thus, the combination of feedforward-like inhibition with fast thalamo-cortical synaptic depression by simple cells receiving a direct structured input from thalamus composes a generic computational mechanism for generating a sparse and reliable encoding of natural sensory events.},

This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.},

	abstract = {A number of recent attempts have been made to describe early sensory coding in terms of a general information processing strategy. In this paper, two strategies are contrasted. Both strategies take advantage of the redundancy in the environment to produce more effective representations. The first is described as a ?compact? coding scheme. A compact code performs a transform that allows the input to be represented with a reduced number of vectors (cells) with minimal {RMS} error. This approach has recently become popular in the neural network literature and is related to a process called Principal Components Analysis ({PCA}). A number of recent papers have suggested that the optimal ?compact? code for representing natural scenes will have units with receptive field profiles much like those found in the retina and primary visual cortex. However, in this paper, it is proposed that compact coding schemes are insufficient to account for the receptive field properties of cells in the mammalian visual pathway. In contrast, it is proposed that the visual system is near to optimal in representing natural scenes only if optimality is defined in terms of ?sparse distributed? coding. In a sparse distributed code, all cells in the code have an equal response probability across the class of images but have a low response probability for any single image. In such a code, the dimensionality is not reduced. Rather, the redundancy of the input is transformed into the redundancy of the firing pattern of cells. It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis). In measurements with 55 calibrated natural scenes, the kurtosis was found to peak when the bandwidths of the visual code matched those of cells in the mammalian visual cortex. Codes resembling ?wavelet transforms? are proposed to be effective because the response histograms of such codes are sparse (i.e., show high kurtosis) when presented with natural scenes. It is proposed that the structure of the image that allows sparse coding is found in the phase spectrum of the image.

	abstract = {Spike count correlations ({SCCs}) are ubiquitous in sensory cortices, are characterized by rich structure and arise from structured internal interactions. Yet, most theories of visual perception focus exclusively on the mean responses of individual neurons. Here, we argue that feedback interactions in primary visual cortex (V1) establish the context in which individual neurons process complex stimuli and that changes in visual context give rise to stimulus-dependent {SCCs}. Measuring V1 population responses to natural scenes in behaving macaques, we show that the fine structure of {SCCs} is stimulus-specific and variations in response correlations across-stimuli are independent of variations in response means. Moreover, we demonstrate that stimulus-specificity of {SCCs} in V1 can be directly manipulated by controlling the high-order structure of synthetic stimuli. We propose that stimulus-specificity of {SCCs} is a natural consequence of hierarchical inference where inferences on the presence of high-level image features modulate inferences on the presence of low-level features.},

	abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to physio-logy and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independent of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away, while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features as necessary conditions to solve the aperture problem. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This solution may give insights into the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.},

	abstract = {From the earliest stages of sensory processing, neurons show inherent non-linearities: the response to a complex stimulus is not a sum of the responses to a set of constituent basis stimuli. These non-linearities come in a number of forms and have been explained in terms of a number of functional goals. The family of spatial non-linearities have included interactions that occur both within and outside of the classical receptive field. They include, saturation, cross orientation inhibition, contrast normalization, end-stopping and a variety of non-classical effects. In addition, neurons show a number of facilitatory and invariance related effects such as those exhibited by complex cells (integration across position). Here, we describe an approach that attempts to explain many of the non-linearities under a single geometric framework. In line with Zetzsche and colleagues (e.g., Zetzsche et al., 1999) we propose that many of the principal non-linearities can be described by a geometry where the neural response space has a simple curvature. In this paper, we focus on the geometry that produces both increased selectivity (curving outward) and increased tolerance (curving inward). We demonstrate that overcomplete sparse coding with both low-dimensional synthetic data and high-dimensional natural scene data can result in curvature that is responsible for a variety of different known non-classical effects including end-stopping and gain control. We believe that this approach provides a more fundamental explanation of these non-linearities and does not require that one postulate a variety of explanations (e.g., that gain must be controlled or the ends of lines must be detected). In its standard form, sparse coding does not however, produce invariance/tolerance represented by inward curvature. We speculate on some of the requirements needed to produce such curvature.},

Next, from the {RF} responses to natural stimuli, we determine the neural computations that are optimal for combining and decoding the responses into estimates of speed. The computations show how selective, invariant speed- tuned units might be constructed by the nervous system. Then, in a psychophysical experiment using matched stimuli, we show that human performance is nearly optimal. Indeed, a single efficiency parameter accurately predicts the detailed shapes of a large set of human psychometric functions. We conclude that many properties of speed-selective neurons and human speed discrimination performance are predicted by the optimal computations, and that natural stimulus variation affects optimal and human observers almost identically.},

Here we use this principle to construct probabilistic models which describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of up to 120 neurons in the salamander retina as it responds to natural movies. Already in groups as small as 10 neurons, interactions between spikes can no longer be regarded as small perturbations in an otherwise independent system; for 40 or more neurons pairwise interactions need to be supplemented by a global interaction that controls the distribution of synchrony in the population. Here we show that such "K-pairwise" models–being systematic extensions of the previously used pairwise Ising models–provide an excellent account of the data. We explore the properties of the neural vocabulary by: 1) estimating its entropy, which constrains the population's capacity to represent visual information; 2) classifying activity patterns into a small set of metastable collective modes; 3) showing that the neural codeword ensembles are extremely inhomogenous; 4) demonstrating that the state of individual neurons is highly predictable from the rest of the population, allowing the capacity for error correction.},

We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference-paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding, coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis, have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism that optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair. By contributing to optimizing statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

We found that, although a simple visuomotor behavior such as short-latency ocular following responses takes advantage of the full distribution of motion signals, perceptual speed discrimination is impaired for stimuli with large bandwidths.

Although a variety of measurements indicate the existence of such dependencies, their origin and importance for neural coding are poorly understood. Here we analyse the functional significance of correlated firing in a complete population of macaque parasol retinal ganglion cells using a model of multi-neuron spike responses. The model, with parameters fit directly to physiological data, simultaneously captures both the stimulus dependence and detailed spatio-temporal correlations in population responses, and provides two insights into the structure of the neural code. First, neural encoding at the population level is less noisy than one would expect from the variability of individual neurons: spike times are more precise, and can be predicted more accurately when the spiking of neighbouring neurons is taken into account. Second, correlations provide additional sensory information: optimal, model-based decoding that exploits the response correlation structure extracts 20\% more information about the visual scene than decoding under the assumption of independence, and preserves 40\% more visual information than optimal linear decoding. This model-based approach reveals the role of correlated activity in the retinal coding of visual stimuli, and provides a general framework for understanding the importance of correlated activity in populations of neurons.},

	abstract = {We investigate the capability of turtle retinal ganglion cell ({RGC}) ensembles to simultaneously encode multiple aspects of visual motion: speed, direction, and acceleration of moving patterns. Bayesian stimulus reconstruction reveals that the instantaneous firing rates of {RGCs} contain information about all of these stimulus properties. Stimulus velocity is mainly encoded by steady-state firing rates, whereas acceleration can be reconstructed from transient components in {RGC} activity induced by abrupt velocity changes. Therefore neurons in higher brain areas may in principle extract information about changing velocity from the instantaneous firing activity of {RGCs}, without the need to compare responses to present velocities to previous ones. However, reconstruction requires the estimation of a combined acceleration and velocity signal, indicating that {RGC} ensembles signal both properties simultaneously. In accordance with this conclusion, combined velocity/acceleration sensitivity enhances the similarity of artificial spike trains to experimental data by 50\% compared with the case of pure velocity tuning. Decoding of motion direction in addition to speed and acceleration requires direction-sensitive cells, which generate higher firing rates for one of the motion directions and therefore show asymmetric velocity tuning. By dividing the entire ensemble of simultaneously recorded cells into one group of direction-sensitive cells and one group with symmetric tuning, we demonstrate that the population of direction-sensitive cells encodes a combination of motion speed, acceleration, and direction. However, estimation of velocity and acceleration is improved by including the larger group of {RGC} responses that are sensitive to speed but not to motion direction.},

	abstract = {Abstract– Meanwhile biorthogonal wavelets got a very popu- lar image processing tool, alternative multiresolution transforms have been proposed for solving some of their drawbacks, namely the poor selectivity in orientation and the lack of translation in- variance due to the aliasing between subbands. These transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. At the same time their optimization get a challenging task. We proposed here a log-Gabor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the Gabor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. Two major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. And second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). The transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. Compared to the state of the art, the log-Gabor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent Gaussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. Such characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.},

Synchronous activity in cat visual cortex was more selective and predictable in discriminating between drifting grating and concentric ring stimuli than changes in firing rate. Synchrony was found even between cells with wholly different orientation preferences when their receptive fields were circularly aligned, and membership in synchronous groups was orientation and curvature dependent. The existence of synchrony between cocircular cells reinforces its role as a general mechanism for contour integration and shape detection as predicted by association field concepts. Our data suggest that cortical synchrony results from common and synchronous input from earlier visual areas and that it could serve to shape extrastriate response selectivity.},

In the early visual system, models based on one or more linear receptive fields hold promise to achieve this goal as long as the models include nonlinear mechanisms that control responsiveness, based on stimulus context and history, and take into account the nonlinearity of spike generation. These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single "standard model" for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation.

Bayesian methods have proven successful in building computational theories for perception and sensorimotor control, and psychophysics is providing a growing body of evidence that human perceptual computations are 'Bayes' optimal'. This leads to the 'Bayesian coding hypothesis': that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty.},

A moving object can cover a considerable distance in this time, and should therefore be seen noticeably behind its actual location. As this conflicts with everyday experience, it has been suggested that the visual cortex uses the delayed visual data from the eye to extrapolate the trajectory of a moving object, so that it is perceived at its actual location. Here we report that such anticipation of moving stimuli begins in the retina. A moving bar elicits a moving wave of spiking activity in the population of retinal ganglion cells. Rather than lagging behind the visual image, the population activity travels near the leading edge of the moving bar. This response is observed over a wide range of speeds and apparently compensates for the visual response latency. We show how this anticipation follows from known mechanisms of retinal processing.},

	abstract = {The processing of spatial information by the visual system shows a number of similarities to the wavelet transforms that have become popular in applied mathematics. Over the last decade, a range of studies have focused on the question of 'why' the visual system would evolve this strategy of coding spatial information. One such approach has focused on the relationship between the visual code and the statistics of natural scenes under the assumption that the visual system has evolved this strategy as a means of optimizing the representation of its visual environment. This paper reviews some of this literature and looks at some of the statistical properties of natural scenes that allow this code to be efficient. It is argued that such wavelet codes are efficient because they increase the independence of the vectors' outputs (i.e. they increase the independence of the responses of the visual neurons) by finding the sparse structure available in the input. Studies with neural networks that attempt to maximize the 'sparsity' of the representation have been shown to produce vectors (neural receptive fields) that have many of the properties of a wavelet representation. It is argued that the visual environment has the appropriate sparse structure to make this sparse output possible. It is argued that these sparse/independent representations make it computationally easier to detect and represent the higher–order structure present in complex environmental data.},

Previously, we have shown that these receptive field properties may be accounted for in terms of a strategy for producing a sparse distribution of output activity in response to natural images. Here, in addition to describing this work in a more expansive fashion, we examine the neurobiological implications of sparse coding. Of particular interest is the case when the code is overcomplete - i.e., when the number of code elements is greater than the effective dimensionality of the input space. Because the basis functions are non-orthogonal and not linearly independent of each other, sparsifying the code will recruit only those basis functions necessary for representing a given input, and so the input-output function will deviate from being purely linear. These deviations from linearity provide a potential explanation for the weak forms of non-linearity observed in the response properties of cortical simple cells, and they further make predictions about the expected interactions among units in response to naturalistic stimuli.},

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

	abstract = {Background. Mobile health and digital medicine technologies are becoming increasingly used by individuals with common, chronic diseases to monitor their health. Numerous devices, sensors, and apps are available to patients and consumers -- some of which have been shown to lead to improved health management and health outcomes. However, no randomized controlled trials have been conducted which examine health care costs, and most have failed to provide study participants with a truly comprehensive monitoring system. Methods. We conducted a prospective randomized controlled trial of adults who had submitted a 2012 health insurance claim associated with hypertension, diabetes, and/or cardiac arrhythmia. The intervention involved receipt of one or more mobile devices that corresponded to their condition(s) and an {iPhone} with linked tracking applications for a period of 6 months; the control group received a standard disease management program. Moreover, intervention study participants received access to an online health management system which provided participants detailed device tracking information over the course of the study. This was a monitoring system designed by leveraging collaborations with device manufacturers, a connected health leader, health care provider, and employee wellness program -- making it both unique and inclusive. We hypothesized that health resource utilization with respect to health insurance claims may be influenced by the monitoring intervention. We also examined health-self management. Results \&amp; Conclusions. There was little evidence of differences in health care costs or utilization as a result of the intervention. Furthermore, we found evidence that the control and intervention groups were equivalent with respect to most health care utilization outcomes. This result suggests there are not large short-term increases or decreases in health care costs or utilization associated with monitoring chronic health conditions using mobile health or digital medicine technologies. Among secondary outcomes there was some evidence of improvement in health self-management which was characterized by a decrease in the propensity to view health status as due to chance factors in the intervention group.

To investigate the mechanism of Rab localization, chimeras containing heterologous Rab hypervariable domains were generated, and their ability to bind seven Rab effectors was quantified. Two chimeras could bind effectors for two distinctly localized Rabs; a Rab5/9 hybrid bound both Rab5 and Rab9 effectors, and a Rab1/9 hybrid bound to certain Rab1 and Rab9 effectors. These unusual chimeras permitted a test of the importance of effector binding for Rab localization. In both cases, changing the cellular concentration of a key Rab9 effector, which is called tail-interacting protein of 47 {kD}, moved a fraction of the proteins from their parental Rab localization to that of Rab9. Thus, relative concentrations of certain competing effectors could determine a chimeras localization. These data confirm the importance of effector interactions for Rab9 localization, and support a model in which effector proteins rely on Rabs as much as Rabs rely on effectors to achieve their correct steady state localizations.},

	abstract = {{FlyBase} (http://flybase.org) is the leading database and web portal for genetic and genomic information on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and related fly species. Whether you use the fruit fly as an experimental system or want to apply Drosophila biological knowledge to another field of study, {FlyBase} can help you successfully navigate the wealth of available Drosophila data. Here, we review the {FlyBase} web site with novice and less-experienced users of {FlyBase} in mind and point out recent developments stemming from the availability of genome-wide data from the {modENCODE} project. The first section of this paper explains the organization of the web site and describes the report pages available on {FlyBase}, focusing on the most popular, the Gene Report. The next section introduces some of the search tools available on {FlyBase}, in particular, our heavily used and recently redesigned search tool {QuickSearch}, found on the {FlyBase} homepage. The final section concerns genomic data, including recent {modENCODE} (http://www.modencode.org) data, available through our Genome Browser, {GBrowse}.},

	abstract = {Almost every neuron in the early visual system has some form of an antagonistic receptive field surround. But the function of the surround is poorly understood, especially under naturalistic stimulus conditions. Anatomical and functional characterization of the surround of retinal ganglion cells suggests that surround signals combine with the excitatory feedforward pathway upstream of an important synaptic nonlinearity between bipolar cells and postsynaptic ganglion cells. This circuit architecture suggests at least two unexplored consequences for receptive field structure. First, center and surround inputs should interact nonlinearly, even prior to the summation across visual space that forms the full receptive field center. Second, inputs to the surround may alter the sensitivity of the center to spatial contrast in a scene. We test these hypotheses using both synthetic and naturalistic visual stimuli, and find that the statistics of natural scenes promote these nonlinear interactions. This work shows that, unexpectedly, the surround modulates spatial contrast encoding based on visual context.},

	abstract = {The predictive processing theory of cognition and neural encoding dictates that hierarchical regions in the neocortex learn and encode predictive hypotheses of current and future stimuli. To better handle uncertainty these regions must also learn, infer, and encode the precision of stimuli. In this treatment we investigate the potential of handling uncertainty within a single learned predictive model. We exploit the rich predictive models formed by the learning of temporal sequences within a Hierarchical Temporal Memory ({HTM}) framework, a cortically inspired connectionist system of selforganizing predictive cells. We weight a cell’s feedforward response by the degree of its own temporal expectations of a response. We test this model on data that has been saturated with temporal or spatial noise, and show signiﬁcant improvements over traditional {HTM} systems. In addition we perform an experiment based on the Posner cuing task and show that the system displays phenomena consistent with attention and biased competition. We conclude that the observed effects are similar to those of precision encoding.},

Nevertheless, the neural code of uncertainty remains elusive. A central hypothesis is that uncertainty is encoded in the population activity of cortical neurons in the form of likelihood functions. Here, we studied the neural code of uncertainty by simultaneously recording population activity in the visual cortex in primates during a visual categorization task for which trial-to-trial uncertainty about stimulus orientation was relevant for the animal's decision. We decoded the likelihood function from the trial-to-trial population activity and found that it predicted the monkey's decisions better than using only a decoded point estimate of the orientation. Critically, this remained true even when we conditioned on the stimulus including its contrast, suggesting that random fluctuations in neural activity firing rates drive behaviorally meaningful variations in the likelihood function. Our results establish the role of population-encoded likelihood functions in mediating behavior and offer potential neural underpinnings for Bayesian models of perception.},

	abstract = {Sparse and convolutional constraints form a natural prior for many optimization problems that arise from physical processes. Detecting motifs in speech and musical passages, super-resolving images, compressing videos, and reconstructing harmonic motions can all leverage redundancies introduced by convolution. Solving problems involving sparse and convolutional constraints remains a difficult computational problem, however. In this paper we present an overview of convolutional sparse coding in a consistent framework. The objective involves iteratively optimizing a convolutional least-squares term for the basis functions, followed by an L1-regularized least squares term for the sparse coefficients. We discuss a range of optimization methods for solving the convolutional sparse coding objective, and the properties that make each method suitable for different applications. In particular, we concentrate on computational complexity, speed to {\textbackslash}epsilon convergence, memory usage, and the effect of implied boundary conditions. We present a broad suite of examples covering different signal and application domains to illustrate the general applicability of convolutional sparse coding, and the efficacy of the available optimization methods.},

However, a comprehensive review on controlling robots based on {SNNs} is still missing. In this paper, we survey the developments of the past decade in the field of spiking neural networks for control tasks, with particular focus on the fast emerging robotics-related applications. We first highlight the primary impetuses of {SNN}-based robotics tasks in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and computation capabilities. We then classify those {SNN}-based robotic applications according to different learning rules and explicate those learning rules with their corresponding robotic applications. We also briefly present some existing platforms that offer an interaction between {SNNs} and robotics simulations for exploration and exploitation. Finally, we conclude our survey with a forecast of future challenges and some associated potential research topics in terms of controlling robots based on {SNNs}.},

	abstract = {In several sensory pathways, input stimuli project to sparsely active downstream populations that have more neurons than incoming axons. Here, we address the computational benefits of expansion and sparseness for clustered inputs, where different clusters represent behaviorally distinct stimuli and intracluster variability represents sensory or neuronal noise. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations, we show that expansion implemented by feed-forward random synaptic weights amplifies variability in the incoming stimuli, and this noise enhancement increases with sparseness of the expanded representation. In addition, the low dimensionality of the input layer generates overlaps between the induced representations of different stimuli, limiting the benefit of expansion. Highly sparse expansive representations obtained through synapses that encode the clustered structure of the input reduce both intrastimulus variability and the excess overlaps between stimuli, enhancing the ability of downstream neurons to perform classification and recognition tasks. Implications for olfactory, cerebellar, and visual processing are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1618-12.2012},
	abstract = {To efficiently drive many behaviors, sensory systems have to integrate the activity of large neuronal populations within a limited time window. These populations need to rapidly achieve a robust representation of the input image, probably through canonical computations such as divisive normalization. However, little is known about the dynamics of the corticocortical interactions implementing these rapid and robust computations. Here, we measured the real-time activity of a large neuronal population in V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in behaving monkeys. We found that contrast gain of the population increases over time with a time constant of ∼30 ms and propagates laterally over the cortical surface. This dynamic is well accounted for by a divisive normalization achieved through a recurrent network that transiently increases in size after response onset with a slow swelling speed of 0.007-0.014 m/s, suggesting a polysynaptic intracortical origin. In the presence of a surround, this normalization pool is gradually balanced by lateral inputs propagating from distant cortical locations. This results in a centripetal propagation of surround suppression at a speed of 0.1-0.3 m/s, congruent with horizontal intracortical axons speed. We propose that a simple generalized normalization scheme can account for both the dynamical contrast response function through recurrent polysynaptic intracortical loops and for the surround suppression through long-range monosynaptic horizontal spread. Our results demonstrate that V1 achieves a rapid and robust context-dependent input normalization through a timely push-pull between local and lateral networks. We suggest that divisive normalization, a fundamental canonical computation, should be considered as a dynamic process.},

	shorttitle = {A neuromorphic systems approach to in-memory computing with non-ideal memristive devices},
	abstract = {Memristive devices represent a promising technology for building neuromorphic electronic systems. In addition to their compactness and non-volatility features, they are characterized by computationally relevant physical properties, such as state-dependence, non-linear conductance changes, and intrinsic variability in both their switching threshold and conductance values, that make them ideal devices for emulating the bio-physics of real synapses. In this paper we present a spiking neural network architecture that supports the use of memristive devices as synaptic elements, and propose mixed-signal analog-digital interfacing circuits which mitigate the effect of variability in their conductance values and exploit their variability in the switching threshold, for implementing stochastic learning. The effect of device variability is mitigated by using pairs of memristive devices configured in a complementary push-pull mechanism and interfaced to a current-mode normalizer circuit. The stochastic learning mechanism is obtained by mapping the desired change in synaptic weight into a corresponding switching probability that is derived from the intrinsic stochastic behavior of memristive devices. We demonstrate the features of the {CMOS} circuits and apply the architecture proposed to a standard neural network hand-written digit classification benchmark based on the {MNIST} data-set. We evaluate the performance of the approach proposed on this benchmark using behavioral-level spiking neural network simulation, showing both the effect of the reduction in conductance variability produced by the current-mode normalizer circuit, and the increase in performance as a function of the number of memristive devices used in each synapse.},

However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly.

	abstract = {Abstract During ongoing and Up state activity, cortical circuits manifest a set of dynamical features that are conserved across these states. The present work systematizes these phenomena by three notions: excitability, the ability to sustain activity without external input; balance, precise coordination of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal inputs; and stability, maintenance of activity at a steady level. Slice preparations exhibiting Up states demonstrate that balanced activity can be maintained by small local circuits. While computational models of cortical circuits have included different combinations of excitability, balance, and stability, they have done so without a systematic quantitative comparison with experimental data. Our study provides quantitative criteria for this purpose, by analyzing in-vitro and in-vivo neuronal activity and characterizing the dynamics on the neuronal and population levels. The criteria are defined with a tolerance that allows for differences between experiments, yet are sufficient to capture commonalities between persistently depolarized cortical network states and to help validate computational models of cortex. As test cases for the derived set of criteria, we analyze three widely used models of cortical circuits and find that each model possesses some of the experimentally observed features, but none satisfies all criteria simultaneously, showing that the criteria are able to identify weak spots in computational models. The criteria described here form a starting point for the systematic validation of cortical neuronal network models, which will help improve the reliability of future models, and render them better building blocks for larger models of the brain.},

The spiking neurons encode useful temporal information and possess highly anti-noise property. The feature extraction ability of typical {SNNs} is limited by shallow structures. This paper focuses on improving the feature extraction ability of {SNNs} in virtue of powerful feature extraction ability of Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}). {CNNs} can extract abstract features resorting to the structure of the convolutional feature maps. We propose a {CNN}-{SNN} ({CSNN}) model to combine feature learning ability of {CNNs} with cognition ability of {SNNs}. The {CSNN} model learns the encoded spatiotemporal representations of images in an event-driven way. We evaluate the {CSNN} model on the {MNIST} and its variants, including learning capabilities, encoding mechanisms, robustness to noisy stimuli and its classiﬁcation performance. The results show that {CSNN} behaves well compared to other cognitive models with signiﬁcantly fewer neurons and training samples.

The robotic challenge here was to make the robot come back home autonomously after being displaced from its initial location. The navigation toolkit of {AntBot} comprises the celestial-based heading direction, and both stride- and ventral optic flow-based odometry, as observed in desert ants. Experimental results show that our bio-inspired approach can be useful for autonomous outdoor navigation robotics in case of {GPS} or magnetometer failure, but also to compensate for a drift of the inertial measurement unit. In addition, our strategy requires few computational resources due to the small number of pixels (only 14 here), and a high robustness and precision (mean error of 4.8 cm for an overall path ranging from 2 m to 5 m). Finally, this work presents highly interesting field results of ant-based theoretical models for homing tasks that have not been tested yet in insectoid robots.},

	abstract = {Deep neural nets with a large number of parameters are very powerful machine learning systems. However, overﬁtting is a serious problem in such networks. Large networks are also slow to use, making it diﬃcult to deal with overﬁtting by combining the predictions of many diﬀerent large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of diﬀerent “thinned” networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the eﬀect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This signiﬁcantly reduces overﬁtting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classiﬁcation and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a signiﬁcant margin. Using an ensemble of batchnormalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on {ImageNet} classiﬁcation: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Moreover, data sharing across the neuroscientific community has become an essential component of data-driven approaches to neuroscience as is evident from the number and scale of ongoing national and multinational projects, engaging scientists from diverse branches of knowledge. In this heterogeneous environment, the need to share neuroscientific data as well as to utilize it across different simulation environments drove the momentum for standardizing data models for neuronal morphologies, biophysical properties, and connectivity schemes. Here, I review existing data models in neuroinformatics, ranging from flat to hybrid object-hierarchical approaches, and suggest a framework with which these models can be linked to experimental data, as well as to established records from existing databases.

These studies also suggest that curvature-tuned neurons are position invariant. We sought to examine the mechanisms that endow V4 neurons with these properties. Consistent with previous studies, we found that response rank order to the most- and least-preferred stimuli was preserved throughout the receptive field. However, a fine-grained analysis of shape tuning revealed a surprising result: V4 neurons tuned to highly curved shapes exhibit very limited translation invariance. At a fine spatial scale, these neurons exhibit local variation in orientation. In contrast, neurons that prefer straight contours exhibit spatially invariant orientation-tuning and homogenous fine-scale orientation maps. Both of these patterns are consistent with a simple orientation-pooling model, with tuning for straight or curved shapes resulting, respectively, from pooling of homogenous or heterogeneous orientation signals inherited from early visual areas.},

However, is remain unclear precisely why the response of retinal ganglion cells ({RGCs}) to simple artiﬁcial stimuli does not predict their response to complex naturalistic stimuli. To explore this topic, we use Motion Clouds ({MC}), which are synthetic textures that preserve properties of natural images and are merely parameterized, in particular by modulating the spatiotemporal spectrum complexity of the stimulus by adjusting the frequency bandwidths. By stimulating the retina of the diurnal rodent, Octodon degus with {MC} we show that the {RGCs} respond to increasingly complex stimuli by narrowing their adjustment curves in response to movement. At the level of the population, complex stimuli produce a sparser code while preserving movement information; therefore, the stimuli are encoded more efﬁciently. Interestingly, these properties were observed throughout different populations of {RGCs}. Thus, our results reveal that the response at the level of {RGCs} is modulated by the naturalness of the stimulus - in particular for motion - which suggests that the tuning to the statistics of natural images already emerges at the level of the retina.},

	doi = {10/gdqbt7},
	abstract = {The normal function of the retina is to convey information about natural visual images. It is this visual environment that has driven evolution, and that is clinically relevant. Yet nearly all of our understanding of the neural computations, biological function, and circuit mechanisms of the retina comes in the context of artificially structured stimuli such as flashing spots, moving bars and white noise. It is fundamentally unclear how these artificial stimuli are related to circuit processes engaged under natural stimuli. A key barrier is the lack of methods for analyzing retinal responses to natural images. We addressed both these issues by applying convolutional neural network models ({CNNs}) to capture retinal responses to natural scenes. We find that {CNN} models predict natural scene responses with high accuracy, achieving performance close to the fundamental limits of predictability set by intrinsic cellular variability. Furthermore, individual internal units of the model are highly correlated with actual retinal interneuron responses that were recorded separately and never presented to the model during training. Finally, we find that models fit only to natural scenes, but not white noise, reproduce a range of phenomena previously described using distinct artificial stimuli, including frequency doubling, latency encoding, motion anticipation, fast contrast adaptation, synchronized responses to motion reversal and object motion sensitivity. Further examination of the model revealed extremely rapid context dependence of retinal feature sensitivity under natural scenes using an analysis not feasible from direct examination of retinal responses. Overall, these results show that nonlinear retinal processes engaged by artificial stimuli are also engaged in and relevant to natural visual processing, and that {CNN} models form a powerful and unifying tool to study how sensory circuitry produces computations in a natural context.},

	abstract = {We discuss a recently proposed approach to solve the classic feature-binding problem in primate vision that uses neural dynamics known to be present within the visual cortex. Broadly, the feature-binding problem in the visual context concerns not only how a hierarchy of features such as edges and objects within a scene are represented, but also the hierarchical relationships between these features at every spatial scale across the visual field. This is necessary for the visual brain to be able to make sense of its visuospatial world. Solving this problem is an important step towards the development of artificial general intelligence. In neural network simulation studies, it has been found that neurons encoding the binding relations between visual features, known as binding neurons, emerge during visual training when key properties of the visual cortex are incorporated into the models. These biological network properties include (i) bottom-up, lateral and top-down synaptic connections, (ii) spiking neuronal dynamics, (iii) spike timing-dependent plasticity, and (iv) a random distribution of axonal transmission delays (of the order of several milliseconds) in the propagation of spikes between neurons. After training the network on a set of visual stimuli, modelling studies have reported observing the gradual emergence of polychronization through successive layers of the network, in which subpopulations of neurons have learned to emit their spikes in regularly repeating spatio-temporal patterns in response to specific visual stimuli. Such a subpopulation of neurons is known as a polychronous neuronal group ({PNG}). Some neurons embedded within these {PNGs} receive convergent inputs from neurons representing lower- and higher-level visual features, and thus appear to encode the hierarchical binding relationship between features. Neural activity with this kind of spatio-temporal structure robustly emerges in the higher network layers even when neurons in the input layer represent visual stimuli with spike timings that are randomized according to a Poisson distribution. The resulting hierarchical representation of visual scenes in such models, including the representation of hierarchical binding relations between lower- and higher-level visual features, is consistent with the hierarchical phenomenology or subjective experience of primate vision and is distinct from approaches interested in segmenting a visual scene into a finite set of objects.},

Biological vision systems use a quite different approach, where the eyes (cameras) sample the visual scene continuously, often with a non-uniform resolution, and generate neural spike events in response to changes in the scene. The resulting spatio-temporal patterns of events are then processed through networks of spiking neurons. Such event-based processing offers advantages in terms of focusing constrained resources on the most salient features of the perceived scene, and those advantages should also accrue to engineered vision systems based upon similar principles. Event-based vision sensors, and event-based processing exemplified by the {SpiNNaker} (Spiking Neural Network Architecture) machine, can be used to model the biological vision pathway at various levels of detail. Here we use this approach to explore structural synaptic plasticity as a possible mechanism whereby biological vision systems may learn the statistics of their inputs without supervision, pointing the way to engineered vision systems with similar online learning capabilities.},

To simulate biological vision’s sensitivity to the vertical direction, we strengthen the feature of filtered orientation in 90° by adding a sharpened replica of the filtered image in 90° before max pooling in C1 layer. Then the phase encoding approach is used to convert the extracted visual features into spike patterns. These spike patterns will be learned by precise-spike-driven-based learning rules in an {SNN}.

The collective neuronal state dynamics of an {SNN} form a nonlinear dynamical system that can be cast as an unconventional model of computation. To realize such an {SNN} on Loihi requires each constituent neuron to locally store and independently update its own spike timing information. However, each Loihi core has limited resources for this purpose and these must be shared by neurons assigned to the same core. In this work, we present a compiler for Loihi that maps the neurons of an {SNN} onto and across Loihi's cores efficiently. We show that a poor neuron-to-core mapping can incur significant energy costs and address this with a greedy algorithm that compiles {SNNs} onto Loihi in a power-efficient manner. In so doing, we highlight the need for further development of compilers for this new, emerging class of architectures.},

We discuss a methodology and software mapping tools that enable the {SoA} {CNN} presented in [1] to be fully executed on-board within a strict 12 fps realtime constraint with no compromise in terms of ﬂight results, while all processing is done with only 94 {mW} on average - 1\% of the power envelope of the deployed nano-aircraft.},

	abstract = {Chronic and acute implants of multi-electrode arrays that cover several mm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ of neural tissue provide simultaneous access to population signals like extracellular potentials and the spiking activity of 100 or more individual neurons. While the recorded data may uncover principles of brain function, its interpretation calls for multiscale computational models with corresponding spatial dimensions and signal predictions. Such models can facilitate the search of mechanisms underlying observed spatiotemporal activity patterns in cortex. Multi-layer spiking neuron network models of local cortical circuits covering {\textasciitilde}1 mm\${\textasciicircum}2\$ have been developed, integrating experimentally obtained neuron-type specific connectivity data and reproducing features of in-vivo spiking statistics. With forward models, local field potentials ({LFPs}) can be computed from the simulated spiking activity. To account for the spatial scale of common neural recordings, we extend a local network and {LFP} model to 4x4 mm\${\textasciicircum}2\$. The upscaling preserves the neuron densities, and introduces distance-dependent connection probabilities and delays. As detailed experimental connectivity data is partially lacking, we address this uncertainty in model parameters by testing parameter combinations within biologically plausible bounds. Based on model predictions of spiking activity and {LFPs}, we find that the upscaling procedure preserves the overall spiking statistics of the original model and reproduces asynchronous irregular spiking across populations and weak pairwise spike-train correlations observed in sensory cortex. In contrast with the weak spike-train correlations, the correlation of {LFP} signals is strong and distance-dependent, compatible with experimental observations. Enhanced spatial coherence in the low-gamma band may explain the recent experimental report of an apparent band-pass filter effect in the spatial reach of the {LFP}.},

	abstract = {The digital neuromorphic hardware {SpiNNaker} has been developed with the aim of enabling large-scale neural network simulations in real time and with low power consumption. Real-time performance is achieved with 1 ms integration time steps, and thus applies to neural networks for which faster time scales of the dynamics can be neglected. By slowing down the simulation, shorter integration time steps and hence faster time scales, which are often biologically relevant, can be incorporated. We here describe the first full-scale simulations of a cortical microcircuit with biological time scales on {SpiNNaker}. Since about half the synapses onto the neurons arise within the microcircuit, larger cortical circuits have only moderately more synapses per neuron. Therefore, the full-scale microcircuit paves the way for simulating cortical circuits of arbitrary size. With approximately 80, 000 neurons and 0.3 billion synapses, this model is the largest simulated on {SpiNNaker} to date. The scale-up is enabled by recent developments in the {SpiNNaker} software stack that allow simulations to be spread across multiple boards. Comparison with simulations using the {NEST} software on a high-performance cluster shows that both simulators can reach a similar accuracy, despite the fixed-point arithmetic of {SpiNNaker}, demonstrating the usability of {SpiNNaker} for computational neuroscience applications with biological time scales and large network size. The runtime and power consumption are also assessed for both simulators on the example of the cortical microcircuit model. To obtain an accuracy similar to that of {NEST} with 0.1 ms time steps, {SpiNNaker} requires a slowdown factor of around 20 compared to real time. The runtime for {NEST} saturates around 3 times real time using hybrid parallelization with {MPI} and multi-threading. However, achieving this runtime comes at the cost of increased power and energy consumption. The lowest total energy consumption for {NEST} is reached at around 144 parallel threads and 4.6 times slowdown. At this setting, {NEST} and {SpiNNaker} have a comparable energy consumption per synaptic event. Our results widen the application domain of {SpiNNaker} and help guide its development, showing that further optimizations such as synapse-centric network representation are necessary to enable real-time simulation of large biological neural networks.},

	abstract = {Recently, evidence has emerged that humans approach learning using Bayesian updating rather than (model-free) reinforcement algorithms in a six-arm restless bandit problem. Here, we investigate what this implies for human appreciation of uncertainty. In our task, a Bayesian learner distinguishes three equally salient levels of uncertainty. First, the Bayesian perceives irreducible uncertainty or risk: even knowing the payoff probabilities of a given arm, the outcome remains uncertain. Second, there is (parameter) estimation uncertainty or ambiguity: payoff probabilities are unknown and need to be estimated. Third, the outcome probabilities of the arms change: the sudden jumps are referred to as unexpected uncertainty. We document how the three levels of uncertainty evolved during the course of our experiment and how it affected the learning rate. We then zoom in on estimation uncertainty, which has been suggested to be a driving force in exploration, in spite of evidence of widespread aversion to ambiguity. Our data corroborate the latter. We discuss neural evidence that foreshadowed the ability of humans to distinguish between the three levels of uncertainty. Finally, we investigate the boundaries of human capacity to implement Bayesian learning. We repeat the experiment with different instructions, reflecting varying levels of structural uncertainty. Under this fourth notion of uncertainty, choices were no better explained by Bayesian updating than by (model-free) reinforcement learning. Exit questionnaires revealed that participants remained unaware of the presence of unexpected uncertainty and failed to acquire the right model with which to implement Bayesian updating.},

Here we show that the above variety of approaches can all be unified into a single common principle, namely Nonlinear Hebbian Learning. When Nonlinear Hebbian Learning is applied to natural images, receptive field shapes were strongly constrained by the input statistics and preprocessing, but exhibited only modest variation across different choices of nonlinearities in neuron models or synaptic plasticity rules. Neither overcompleteness nor sparse network activity are necessary for the development of localized receptive fields. The analysis of alternative sensory modalities such as auditory models or V2 development lead to the same conclusions. In all examples, receptive fields can be predicted a priori by reformulating an abstract model as nonlinear Hebbian learning. Thus nonlinear Hebbian learning and natural statistics can account for many aspects of receptive field formation across models and sensory modalities.},

	abstract = {We present a model of intermediate-level visual representation that is based on learning invariances from movies of the natural environment. The model is composed of two stages of processing: an early feature representation layer and a second layer in which invariances are explicitly represented. Invariances are learned as the result of factoring apart the temporally stable and dynamic components embedded in the early feature representation. The structure contained in these components is made explicit in the activities of second-layer units that capture invariances in both form and motion. When trained on natural movies, the first layer produces a factorization, or separation, of image content into a temporally persistent part representing local edge structure and a dynamic part representing local motion structure, consistent with known response properties in early visual cortex (area V1). This factorization linearizes statistical dependencies among the first-layer units, making them learnable by the second layer. The second-layer units are split into two populations according to the factorization in the first layer. The form-selective units receive their input from the temporally persistent part (local edge structure) and after training result in a diverse set of higher-order shape features consisting of extended contours, multiscale edges, textures, and texture boundaries. The motion-selective units receive their input from the dynamic part (local motion structure) and after training result in a representation of image translation over different spatial scales and directions, in addition to more complex deformations. These representations provide a rich description of dynamic natural images and testable hypotheses regarding intermediate-level representation in visual cortex.},

	abstract = {A conceptual and computational framework is proposed for modelling of human sensorimotor con-trol, and is exemplified for the sensorimotor task of steering a car. The framework emphasises control inter-mittency, and extends on existing models by suggesting that the nervous system implements intermittent con-trol using a combination of (1) motor primitives, (2) prediction of sensory outcomes of motor actions, and (3) evidence accumulation of prediction errors. It is shown that approximate but useful sensory predictions in the intermittent control context can be constructed without detailed forward models, as a superposition of simple prediction primitives, resembling neurobiologically ob-served corollary discharges. The proposed mathemati-cal framework allows straightforward extension to inter-mittent behaviour from existing one-dimensional con-tinuous models in the linear control and ecological psy-chology traditions. Empirical observations from a driv-ing simulator provide support for some of the frame-work assumptions: It is shown that human steering con-trol, in routine lane-keeping and in a demanding near-limit task, is better described as a sequence of discrete stepwise steering adjustments, than as continuous con-trol. Furthermore, the amplitudes of individual steer-ing adjustments are well predicted by a compound vi-sual cue signalling steering error, and even better so if also adjusting for predictions of how the same cue is af-fected by previous control. Finally, evidence accumula-tion is shown to explain observed covariability between inter-adjustment durations and adjustment amplitudes, seemingly better so than the type of threshold mecha-nisms that are typically assumed in existing models of intermittent control.

One particularly important early process in visual object recognition is that of grouping together edges which belong to the same contour. The layout of edges in natural scenes have strong statistical structure. One such statistical property is that edges tend to lie on a common circle, and this 'co-circularity' can predict human performance at contour grouping. We therefore tested the hypothesis that long-range excitatory lateral connections in the primary visual cortex, which are believed to be involved in contour grouping, display a similar co-circular structure.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}{nRESULTS}: By analyzing data from tree shrews, where information on both lateral connectivity and the overall structure of the orientation map was available, we found a surprising diversity in the relevant statistical structure of the connections.

	abstract = {Orientation selectivity is the most striking feature of simple cell coding in V1 that has been shown to emerge from the reduction of higher-order correlations in natural images in a large variety of statistical image models. The most parsimonious one among these models is linear Independent Component Analysis ({ICA}), whereas second-order decorrelation transformations such as Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) do not yield oriented filters. Because of this finding, it has been suggested that the emergence of orientation selectivity may be explained by higher-order redundancy reduction. To assess the tenability of this hypothesis, it is an important empirical question how much more redundancy can be removed with {ICA} in comparison to {PCA} or other second-order decorrelation methods. Although some previous studies have concluded that the amount of higher-order correlation in natural images is generally insignificant, other studies reported an extra gain for {ICA} of more than 100\%. A consistent conclusion about the role of higher-order correlations in natural images can be reached only by the development of reliable quantitative evaluation methods. Here, we present a very careful and comprehensive analysis using three evaluation criteria related to redundancy reduction: In addition to the multi-information and the average log-loss, we compute complete rate-distortion curves for {ICA} in comparison with {PCA}. Without exception, we find that the advantage of the {ICA} filters is small. At the same time, we show that a simple spherically symmetric distribution with only two parameters can fit the data significantly better than the probabilistic model underlying {ICA}. This finding suggests that, although the amount of higher-order correlation in natural images can in fact be significant, the feature of orientation selectivity does not yield a large contribution to redundancy reduction within the linear filter bank models of V1 simple cells.},

	abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

We show here that a new unsupervised learning algorithm based on information maximization, a nonlinear 'infomax' network, when applied to an ensemble of natural scenes produces sets of visual filters that are localized and oriented. Some of these filters are Gabor-like and resemble those produced by the sparseness-maximization network. In addition, the outputs of these filters are as independent as possible, since this infomax network performs Independent Components Analysis or {ICA}, for sparse (super-gaussian) component distributions. We compare the resulting {ICA} filters and their associated basis functions, with other decorrelating filters produced by Principal Components Analysis ({PCA}) and zero-phase whitening filters ({ZCA}). The {ICA} filters have more sparsely distributed (kurtotic) outputs on natural scenes. They also resemble the receptive fields of simple cells in visual cortex, which suggests that these neurons form a natural, information-theoretic coordinate system for natural images.},

We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving {OFR}, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barthélemy, F.V., Vanzetta, I., Masson, G.S., 2006.

These transforms are generally overcomplete and consequently offer huge degrees of freedom in their design. At the same time their optimization get a challenging task. We proposed here a log-Gabor wavelet transform gathering the excellent mathematical properties of the Gabor functions with a carefully construction to maintain the properties of the filters and to permit exact reconstruction. Two major improvements are proposed: first the highest frequency bands are covered by narrowly localized oriented filters. And second, all the frequency bands including the highest and lowest frequencies are uniformly covered so as exact reconstruction is achieved using the same filters in both the direct and the inverse transforms (which means that the transform is self-invertible). The transform is optimized not only mathematically but it also follows as much as possible the knowledge on the receptive field of the simple cells of the Primary Visual Cortex (V1) of primates and on the statistics of natural images. Compared to the state of the art, the log-Gabor wavelets show excellent behavior in their ability to segregate the image information (e.g. the contrast edges) from incoherent Gaussian noise by hard thresholding and to code the image features through a reduced set of coefficients with large magnitude. Such characteristics make the transform a promising tool for general image processing tasks.},

	volume = {7},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002250},
	abstract = {Sparse coding algorithms trained on natural images can accurately predict the features that excite visual cortical neurons, but it is not known whether such codes can be learned using biologically realistic plasticity rules. We have developed a biophysically motivated spiking network, relying solely on synaptically local information, that can predict the full diversity of V1 simple cell receptive field shapes when trained on natural images. This represents the first demonstration that sparse coding principles, operating within the constraints imposed by cortical architecture, can successfully reproduce these receptive fields. We further prove, mathematically, that sparseness and decorrelation are the key ingredients that allow for synaptically local plasticity rules to optimize a cooperative, linear generative image model formed by the neural representation. Finally, we discuss several interesting emergent properties of our network, with the intent of bridging the gap between theoretical and experimental studies of visual cortex. In a sparse coding model, individual input stimuli are represented by the activities of model neurons, the majority of which are inactive in response to any particular stimulus. For a given class of stimuli, the neurons are optimized so that the stimuli can be faithfully represented with the minimum number of co-active units. This has been proposed as a model for visual cortex. While it has previously been demonstrated that sparse coding model neurons, when trained on natural images, learn to represent the same features as do neurons in primate visual cortex, it remains to be demonstrated that this can be achieved with physiologically realistic plasticity rules. In particular, learning in cortex appears to occur by the modification of synaptic connections between neurons, which must depend only on information available locally, at the synapse, and not, for example, on the properties of large numbers of distant cells. We provide the first demonstration that synaptically local plasticity rules are sufficient to learn a sparse image code, and to account for the observed response properties of visual cortical neurons: visual cortex actually could learn a sparse image code.},

Most previous works consider sparse synthesis priors where the sparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the signal in a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis regularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and the atoms in the dictionary. The corresponding variational problem includes several well-known regularizations such as the discrete total variation and the fused lasso. We give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal is the unique solution of the analysis regularization when there is no noise in the observations. The same criterion ensures the robustness of the sparse analysis solution to a small noise in the observations. We also define a stronger sufficient condition that ensures robustness to an arbitrary bounded noise. In the special case of synthesis regularization, our contributions recover already known results, that are hence generalized to the analysis setting. We illustrate these theoritical results on practical examples to study the robustness of the total variation and the fused lasso regularizations.},

	abstract = {Horizontal connections, formed primarily by the axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, extend for millimeters parallel to the cortical surface and form patchy terminations. Previous studies have provided evidence that the patches formed by horizontal connections exhibit modular specificity, preferentially linking columns of neurons with similar response characteristics, such as preferred orientation. The issue of how these connections are distributed with respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not been resolved. Here we combine optical imaging of intrinsic signals with small extracellular injections of biocytin to assess quantitatively the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the map of orientation preference and the map of visual space in tree shrew V1. Our results indicate that horizontal connections outside a radius of 500 microm from the injection site exhibit not only modular specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons, along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 microm, the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred orientations. The system of long-range horizontal connections can be summarized as preferentially linking neurons with co-oriented, co-axially aligned receptive fields. These observations suggest specific ways that horizontal circuits contribute to the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons and to mechanisms of visual perception.},

This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.},

Robust face detection and identification algorithms are already readily available to consumers, and modern computer vision algorithms for generic object recognition are now coping with the richness and complexity of natural visual scenes. Unlike early vision models of object recognition that emphasized the role of figure-ground segmentation and spatial information between parts, recent successful approaches are based on the computation of loose collections of image features without prior segmentation or any explicit encoding of spatial relations. While these models remain simplistic models of visual processing, they suggest that, in principle, bottom-up activation of a loose collection of image features could support the rapid recognition of natural object categories and provide an initial coarse visual representation before more complex visual routines and attentional mechanisms take place. Focusing on biologically plausible computational models of (bottom-up) pre-attentive visual recognition, we review some of the key visual features that have been described in the literature. We discuss the consistency of these feature-based representations with classical theories from visual psychology and test their ability to account for human performance on a rapid object categorization task.},

	volume = {6},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0025506},
	abstract = {To what extent are sensory responses in the brain compatible with first-order principles? The efficient coding hypothesis projects that neurons use as few spikes as possible to faithfully represent natural stimuli. However, many sparsely firing neurons in higher brain areas seem to violate this hypothesis in that they respond more to familiar stimuli than to nonfamiliar stimuli. We reconcile this discrepancy by showing that efficient sensory responses give rise to stimulus selectivity that depends on the stimulus-independent firing threshold and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We construct a cost function that enforces minimal firing rates in model neurons by linearly punishing suprathreshold synaptic currents. By contrast, subthreshold currents are punished quadratically, which allows us to optimally reconstruct sensory inputs from elicited responses. We train synaptic currents on many renditions of a particular bird's own song ({BOS}) and few renditions of conspecific birds' songs ({CONs}). During training, model neurons develop a response selectivity with complex dependence on the firing threshold. At low thresholds, they fire densely and prefer {CON} and the reverse {BOS} ({REV}) over {BOS}. However, at high thresholds or when hyperpolarized, they fire sparsely and prefer {BOS} over {REV} and over {CON}. Based on this selectivity reversal, our model suggests that preference for a highly familiar stimulus corresponds to a high-threshold or strong-inhibition regime of an efficient coding strategy. Our findings apply to songbird mirror neurons, and in general, they suggest that the brain may be endowed with simple mechanisms to rapidly change selectivity of neural responses to focus sensory processing on either familiar or nonfamiliar stimuli. In summary, we find support for the efficient coding hypothesis and provide new insights into the interplay between the sparsity and selectivity of neural responses.},

The anatomy that underlies retinotopy and ocular dominance is well known, but no anatomical structure related to orientation selectivity has been found in primates. We examined whether the arrangement of local axon systems projecting within the cortical layers might be correlated with orientation preference in New World monkeys. We found that axons in layer 3 spread out from the site of a tracer injection in an anisotropic manner and that this elongated distribution is aligned with the preferred orientation recorded at each site. Moreover, within a few degrees of the foveal representation, the majority of the axon terminals fall within or just outside of the limits of the cortical mapping of the classical receptive field. Thus local axons produce a field of monosynaptic excitation that aligns with orientation axes and reaches neurons that have receptive fields which are adjacent in visual space.},

We will first present the retinal model which was introduced by Van Rullen and Thorpe [1] and which represents the multi- scale contrast values of the image using an orthonormal wavelet transform. These analog values activate a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for arbitrary —and possibly non-orthogonal— representations of features in the images. In particular, we compared the perfor- mance of increasingly over-complete representations in the retina. Results show that this algorithm provides an efficient spike coding strategy for low-level visual processing which may adapt to the complexity of the visual input.},

	abstract = {To understand possible strategies of temporal spike coding in the central nervous system, we study functional neuromimetic models of visual processing for static images. We will first present the retinal model which was introduced by Van Rullen and Thorpe and which represents the multiscale contrast values of the image using an orthonormal wavelet transform. These analog values activate a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for arbitrary–and possibly nonorthogonal–representations of features in the images. In particular, we compared the performance of increasingly over-complete representations in the retina. Results show that this algorithm provides an efficient spike coding strategy for low-level visual processing which may adapt to the complexity of the visual input.},

However, what drives in vivo development of receptive fields remains controversial. The strongest evidence for the importance of sensory experience in visual development comes from receptive field changes in animals reared with abnormal visual input. However, most sparse coding accounts have considered only normal visual input and the development of monocular receptive fields. Here, we applied three sparse coding models to binocular receptive field development across six abnormal rearing conditions. In every condition, the changes in receptive field properties previously observed experimentally were matched to a similar and highly faithful degree by all the models, suggesting that early sensory development can indeed be understood in terms of an impetus towards sparsity. As previously predicted in the literature, we found that asymmetries in inter-ocular correlation across orientations lead to orientation-specific binocular receptive fields. Finally we used our models to design a novel stimulus that, if present during rearing, is predicted by the sparsity principle to lead robustly to radically abnormal receptive fields.},

While this approach was originally inspired by insights into cortical information processing, biologically plausible approaches have been limited to exploring the functionality of early sensory processing in the brain, while more practical applications have employed non-biologically plausible sparse coding algorithms. Here, a biologically plausible algorithm is proposed that can be applied to practical problems. This algorithm is evaluated using standard benchmark tasks in the domain of pattern classification, and its performance is compared to a wide range of alternative algorithms that are widely used in signal and image processing. The results show that for the classification tasks performed here, the proposed method is competitive with the best of the alternative algorithms that have been evaluated. This demonstrates that classification using sparse representations can be performed in a neurally plausible manner, and hence, that this mechanism of classification might be exploited by the brain.},

	abstract = {Neurons are often assumed to operate in a highly unreliable manner: a neuron can signal the same stimulus with a variable number of action potentials. However, much of the experimental evidence supporting this view was obtained in the visual cortex. We have, therefore, assessed trial-to-trial variability in the auditory cortex of the rat. To ensure single-unit isolation, we used cell-attached recording. Tone-evoked responses were usually transient, often consisting of, on average, only a single spike per stimulus. Surprisingly, the majority of responses were not just transient, but were also binary, consisting of 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to each stimulus; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100\% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. The variability of such binary responses differs from comparably transient responses recorded in visual cortical areas such as area {MT}, and represent the lowest trial-to-trial variability mathematically possible for responses of a given firing rate. Our study thus establishes for the first time that transient responses in auditory cortex can be described as a binary process, rather than as a highly variable Poisson process. These results demonstrate that cortical architecture can support a more precise control of spike number than was previously recognized, and they suggest a re-evaluation of models of cortical processing that assume noisiness to be an inevitable feature of cortical codes.},

In visual cortex (V1), ongoing activity is present in vivo, and spiking responses to simple stimuli are highly unreliable across trials. Stimulus statistics used to plot receptive fields, however, are quite different from those experienced during natural visuomotor exploration. We recorded V1 neurons intracellularly in the anaesthetized and paralyzed cat and compared their spiking and synaptic responses to full field natural images animated by simulated eye-movements to those evoked by simpler (grating) or higher dimensionality statistics (dense noise). In most cells, natural scene animation was the only condition where high temporal precision (in the 10-20 ms range) was maintained during sparse and reliable activity. At the subthreshold level, irregular but highly reproducible membrane potential dynamics were observed, even during long (several 100 ms) “spike-less” periods. We showed that both the spatial structure of natural scenes and the temporal dynamics of eye-movements increase the signal-to-noise ratio by a non linear amplification of the signal combined with a reduction of the subthreshold contextual noise. These data support the view that the sparsening and the time precision of the neural code in V1 may depend primarily on three factors: 1) broadband input spectrum: the bandwidth must be rich enough for recruiting optimally the diversity of spatial and time constants during recurrent processing; 2) tight temporal interplay of excitation and inhibition: conductance measurements demonstrate that natural scene statistics narrow selectively the duration of the spiking opportunity window during which the balance between excitation and inhibition changes transiently and reversibly; 3) signal energy in the lower frequency band: a minimal level of power is needed below 10 Hz to reach consistently the spiking threshold, a situation rarely reached with visual dense noise.},

There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalised coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalised coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the generative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements—in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system—like the oculomotor system—tries to control its environment with delayed signals.},

For a given input, {SC} minimizes a quadratic reconstruction error with an L1 penalty term on the code. The process is often too slow for applications such as real-time pattern recognition. We proposed two versions of a very fast algorithm that produces approximate estimates of the sparse code that can be used to compute good visual features, or to initialize exact iterative algorithms. The main idea is to train a non-linear, feed-forward predictor with a speciﬁc architecture and a ﬁxed depth to produce the best possible approximation of the sparse code. A version of the method, which can be seen as a trainable version of Li and Osher’s coordinate descent method, is shown to produce approximate solutions with 10 times less computation than Li and Osher’s for the same approximation error. Unlike previous proposals for sparse code predictors, the system allows a kind of approximate “explaining away” to take place during inference. The resulting predictor is diﬀerentiable and can be included into globallytrained recognition systems.},

This framework consists of a graphical interface for interactive labeling of body parts and software for training the network and fast prediction on new data (1 hr to train, 185 Hz predictions). We validate {LEAP} using videos of freely behaving fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and track 32 distinct points on the body to fully describe the pose of the head, body, wings, and legs with an error rate of \&lt;3\% of the animal9s body length. We recapitulate a number of reported findings on insect gait dynamics and show {LEAP}9s applicability as the first step in unsupervised behavioral classification.

	abstract = {Summary
The hippocampus constructs a map of the environment. How this “cognitive map” is utilized by other brain regions to guide behavior remains unexplored. To examine how neuronal firing patterns in the hippocampus are transmitted and transformed, we recorded neurons in its principal subcortical target, the lateral septum ({LS}). We observed that {LS} neurons carry reliable spatial information in the phase of action potentials, relative to hippocampal theta oscillations, while the firing rates of {LS} neurons remained uninformative. Furthermore, this spatial phase code had an anatomical microstructure within the {LS} and was bound to the hippocampal spatial code by synchronous gamma frequency cell assemblies. Using a data-driven model, we show that rate-independent spatial tuning arises through the dynamic weighting of {CA}1 and {CA}3 cell assemblies. Our findings demonstrate that transformation of the hippocampal spatial map depends on higher-order theta-dependent neuronal sequences.},

This was my response to a question I was asked to address in a recent {AEON} piece (https://aeon.co/essays/consciousness-is-not-a-thing-but-a-process-of-inference). What follows is based upon the notes for that essay, with a special focus on self-organisation, self-evidencing and self-modelling. I will try to substantiate my (polemic) answer from the perspective of a physicist. In brief, the argument goes as follows: if we want to talk about creatures, like ourselves, then we have to identify the characteristic behaviours they must exhibit. This is fairly easy to do by noting that living systems return to a set of attracting states time and time again. Mathematically, this implies the existence of a Lyapunov function that turns out to be model evidence (i.e., self-evidence) in Bayesian statistics or surprise (i.e., self-information) in information theory. This means that all biological processes can be construed as performing some form of inference, from evolution through to conscious processing. If this is the case, at what point do we invoke consciousness? The proposal on offer here is that the mind comes into being when self-evidencing has a temporal thickness or counterfactual depth, which grounds inferences about the consequences of my action. On this view, consciousness is nothing more than inference about my future; namely, the self-evidencing consequences of what I could do.},

These interactions are mediated by canonical patterns of connectivity in which higher areas send feedback projections to lower areas via neurons in superficial and deep layers. Here, we probed the circuit basis of interactions among two areas critical for touch perception in mice, whisker primary ({wS}1) and secondary ({wS}2) somatosensory cortices. Neurons in layer 4 of {wS}2 (S2$_{\textrm{L4}}$) formed a major feedback pathway to {wS}1. Feedback from {wS}2 to {wS}1 was organized somatotopically. Spikes evoked by whisker deflections occurred nearly as rapidly in {wS}2 as in {wS}1, including among putative S2$_{\textrm{L4}}$ → S1 feedback neurons. Axons from S2$_{\textrm{L4}}$ → S1 neurons sent stimulus orientation-specific activity to {wS}1. Optogenetic excitation of S2$_{\textrm{L4}}$ neurons modulated activity across both {wS}2 and {wS}1, while inhibition of S2$_{\textrm{L4}}$ reduced orientation tuning among {wS}1 neurons. Thus, a non-canonical feedback circuit, originating in layer 4 of S2, rapidly modulates early tactile processing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those previously described in the cat. On the average, however, receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned. The upper layers ({II} and the upper two-thirds of {III}) contain complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells are found deep in layer {III}, and in {IV} A and {IV} B. In layer {IV} B they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex cells are rare. In layers {IV} A and {IV} B one finds units lacking orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer {IV} most cells are driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and {VI} contain mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common features) stimulus dimensions such as retinal position, line orientation, ocular dominance, and perhaps directionality of movement, are mapped in sets of superimposed but independent mosaics. The horizontal system segregates cells in layers by hierarchical orders, the lowest orders (simple cells monocularly driven) located in and near layer {IV}, the higher orders in the upper and lower layers.},

Yet, existing models have failed to predict the diverse shapes of receptive fields that occur in nature. The existing models used a particular "soft" form of sparseness that limits average neuronal activity. Here we study models of efficient coding in a broader context by comparing soft and "hard" forms of neuronal sparseness. As a result of our analyses, we propose a novel network model for visual cortex. The model forms efficient visual representations in which the number of active neurones, rather than mean neuronal activity, is limited. This form of hard sparseness also economises cortical resources like synaptic memory and metabolic energy. Furthermore, our model accurately predicts the distribution of receptive field shapes found in the primary visual cortex of cat and monkey.},

	abstract = {Neurons in the visual cortex process a local region of visual space, but in order to adequately analyze natural images, neurons need to interact. The notion of an ” association field” proposes that neurons interact to extract extended contours. Here, we identify the site and properties of contour integration mechanisms. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and population receptive field ({pRF}) analyses. We devised {pRF} mapping stimuli consisting of contours. We isolated the contribution of contour integration mechanisms to the {pRF} by manipulating the contour content. This stimulus manipulation led to systematic changes in {pRF} size. Whereas a bank of Gabor filters quantitatively explains {pRF} size changes in V1, only V2/V3 {pRF} sizes match the predictions of the association field. {pRF} size changes in later visual field maps, {hV}4, {LO}-1, and {LO}-2 do not follow either prediction and are probably driven by distinct classical receptive field properties or other extraclassical integration mechanisms. These {pRF} changes do not follow conventional {fMRI} signal strength measures. Therefore, analyses of {pRF} changes provide a novel computational neuroimaging approach to investigating neural interactions. We interpreted these results as evidence for neural interactions along co-oriented, cocircular receptive fields in the early extrastriate visual cortex (V2/V3), consistent with the notion of a contour association field.},

This process, thought to be stimulus driven and hard wired, has substrates in primary visual cortex (V1).

In naive monkeys, the information about contours embedded in complex backgrounds is absent in V1 neuronal responses and is independent of the locus of spatial attention. Training animals to find embedded contours induces strong contour-related responses specific to the trained retinotopic region. These responses are most robust when animals perform the contour detection task but disappear under anesthesia. Our findings suggest that top-down influences dynamically adapt neural circuits according to specific perceptual tasks. This may serve as a general neuronal mechanism of perceptual learning and reflect top-down mediated changes in cortical states.},

It remains a challenging issue to understand how the diverse shapes of V1 simple cell receptive fields emerge in visual cortex. This paper presents a biologically plausible learning algorithm, named Hebbian-based mean shift, for this problem. The L0-norm constraint optimizes the number of basis functions rather than their coefficients. We report that the optimization procedure is essentially a 0–1 programming of the selection of basis functions. By assuming that the basis functions are independently selected from a basis set, we find the spatial distribution of input samples containing a special basis function has a star shape and peaks at this basis function. Thus, learning the basis functions for sparse coding with the L0-norm can be interpreted as mode detection where the basis functions are the modes of the kernel density estimate. We employ mean shift to detect modes and prove that the updating rule for the mean shift is Hebbian. The simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm in producing both Gabor-like and blob-like basis functions.},

We recorded extracellularly from single cells in macaque V1 to map the {AF}, by using an optimization algorithm to find the contours that maximally activated individual cells. We combined the algorithm with a delayed-match-to-sample task, to test how the optimal contours might be molded by the monkey's expectation for particular cue shapes. We found that V1 neurons were selective for complex shapes, a property previously ascribed to higher cortical areas. Furthermore, the shape selectivity was reprogrammed by perceptual task: Over the whole network, the optimal modes of geometric selectivity shifted between distinct subsets of the {AF}, alternately representing different stimulus features known to predominate in natural scenes. Our results suggest a general model of cortical function, whereby horizontal connections provide a broad domain of potential associations, and top–down inputs dynamically gate these linkages to task switch the function of a network.},

	abstract = {The problem of signal representation in terms of basis vectors from a large, over-complete, spanning dictionary has been the focus of much research. Achieving a succinct, or `sparse', representation is known as the problem of best basis representation. Methods are considered which seek to solve this problem by sequentially building up a basis set for the signal. Three distinct algorithm types have appeared in the literature which are here termed basic matching pursuit ({BMP}), order recursive matching pursuit ({ORMP}) and modified matching pursuit ({MMP}). The algorithms are first described and then their computation is closely examined. Modifications are made to each of the procedures which improve their computational efficiency. The complexity of each algorithm is considered in two contexts; one where the dictionary is variable (time-dependent) and the other where the dictionary is fixed (time-independent). Experimental results are presented which demonstrate that the {ORMP} method is the best procedure in terms of its ability to give the most compact signal representation, followed by {MMP} and then {BMP} which gives the poorest results. Finally, weighing the performance of each algorithm, its computational complexity and the type of dictionary available, recommendations are made as to which algorithm should be used for a given problem},

Among the cost functions we examine are approximate l(p) norms (0 ≤ p ≤ 2), modified l(p)-norms, block-l1 norms, and reweighted algorithms.

	abstract = {If modern computers are sometimes superior to cognition in some specialized tasks such as playing chess or browsing a large database, they can't beat the efficiency of biological vision for such simple tasks as recognizing a relative or following an object in a complex background. We present in this paper our attempt at outlining the dynamical, parallel and event-based representation for vision in the architecture of the central nervous system. We will illustrate this by showing that in a signal matching framework, a L/{LN} (linear/non-linear) cascade may efficiently transform a sensory signal into a neural spiking signal and we apply this framework to a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete basis as is necessary for modeling the primary visual cortex: we therefore optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral interactions. We compare the efficiency of this representation in terms of compression as the reconstruction quality as a function of the coding length. This will correspond to a modification of the Matching Pursuit algorithm where the {ArgMax} function is optimized for competition, or Competition Optimized Matching Pursuit ({COMP}). We will particularly focus on bridging neuroscience and image processing and on the advantages of such an interdisciplinary approach.},

	abstract = {Sparse coding models of natural scenes can account for several physiological properties of primary visual cortex (V1), including the shapes of simple cell receptive fields ({RFs}) and the highly kurtotic firing rates of V1 neurons. Current spiking network models of pattern learning and sparse coding require direct inhibitory connections between the excitatory simple cells, in conflict with the physiological distinction between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory ({GABAergic}) neurons (Dale's Law). At the same time, the computational role of inhibitory neurons in cortical microcircuit function has yet to be fully explained. Here we show that adding a separate population of inhibitory neurons to a spiking model of V1 provides conformance to Dale's Law, proposes a computational role for at least one class of interneurons, and accounts for certain observed physiological properties in V1. When trained on natural images, this excitatory–inhibitory spiking circuit learns a sparse code with Gabor-like {RFs} as found in V1 using only local synaptic plasticity rules. The inhibitory neurons enable sparse code formation by suppressing predictable spikes, which actively decorrelates the excitatory population. The model predicts that only a small number of inhibitory cells is required relative to excitatory cells and that excitatory and inhibitory input should be correlated, in agreement with experimental findings in visual cortex. We also introduce a novel local learning rule that measures stimulus-dependent correlations between neurons to support ” explaining away” mechanisms in neural coding.},

However, theoretical and experimental studies have used different definitions of the term "sparse" leading to three assumptions about the nature of sparse codes. First, codes that have high lifetime sparseness require few action potentials. Second, lifetime-sparse codes are also population-sparse. Third, neural codes are optimized to maximize lifetime sparseness. Here, we examine these assumptions in detail and test their validity in primate visual cortex. We show that lifetime and population sparseness are not necessarily correlated and that a code may have high lifetime sparseness regardless of how many action potentials it uses. We measure lifetime sparseness during presentation of natural images in three areas of macaque visual cortex, V1, V2, and V4. We find that lifetime sparseness does not increase across the visual hierarchy. This suggests that the neural code is not simply optimized to maximize lifetime sparseness. We also find that firing rates during a challenging visual task are higher than theoretical values based on metabolic limits and that responses in V1, V2, and V4 are well-described by exponential distributions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurons are optimized to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic constraints on mean firing rate.},

For instance, rearing cats in an environment of stripes of one orientation yields an over-representation of that orientation in V1. However, whether such changes also affect the higher-order statistics of orientation maps is unknown. A statistical bias of orientation maps in normally raised animals is that the probability of the angular difference in orientation preference between each pair of points in the cortex depends on the angle of the line joining those points relative to a fixed but arbitrary set of axes. Natural images show an analogous statistical bias; however, whether this drives the development of comparable structure in V1 is unknown. We examined these statistics for normal, stripe-reared and dark-reared cats, and found that the biases present were not consistently related to those present in the input, or to genetic relationships. We compared these results with two computational models of orientation map development, an analytical model and a Hebbian model. The analytical model failed to reproduce the experimentally observed statistics. In the Hebbian model, while orientation difference statistics could be strongly driven by the input, statistics similar to those seen in experimental maps arose only when symmetry breaking was allowed to occur spontaneously. These results suggest that these statistical biases of orientation maps arise primarily spontaneously, rather than being governed by either input statistics or genetic mechanisms.},

	url = {http://invibe.net/LaurentPerrinet/Publications/Perrinet11sfn},
	abstract = {Oriented edges in images of natural scenes tend to be aligned in collinear or co-circular arrangements, with lines and smooth curves more common than other possible arrangements of edges (Geisler et al., Vis Res 41:711-24, 2001). The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an "association field" (Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a more general edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse coding to avoid multiple responses to a single edge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for natural images replicated qualitatively the results from Geisler et al. (2001), confirming that prior information about continuations appeared consistently in natural images. However, we find that the largely man-made environment in which these animals were reared has a significantly higher probability of collinear edge elements. We thus predict that if the lateral connection patterns are due to visual experience, the patterns in wild-raised tree shrews would be very different from those measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with shorter-range correlations and less emphasis on collinear continuations. This prediction can be tested in future experiments on matching groups of animals reared in different environments. W.H. Bosking and Y. Zhang and B. Schofield and D.

We apply such an analysis to successfully distinguish a set of authentic drawings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder from another set of well-known Bruegel imitations. We show that our approach, which involves a direct comparison based on a single relevant statistic, offers a natural and potentially more germane alternative to wavelet-based classification techniques that rely on more complicated statistical frameworks. Specifically, we show that our model provides a method capable of discriminating between authentic and imitation Bruegel drawings that numerically outperforms well-known existing approaches.

	abstract = {The Gestalt law of "good continuation" has been used to describe a variety of phenomena demonstrating the importance of continuity in human perception. In this study, we consider how continuity may be represented by a visual system that filters spatial data using arrays of cells selective for orientation and spatial frequency. Many structures (e.g. fractal contours) show a form of redundancy which is well represented by the continuity of features as they vary across space and frequency. We suggest that it is possible to take advantage of the redundancy in continuous, but non-aligned features by associating the outputs of filters with similar tuning. Five experiments were performed, to determine the rules that govern the perception of continuity. Observers were presented with arrays of oriented, band-pass elements (Gabor patches) in which a subset of the elements was aligned along a "jagged" path. Using a forced-choice procedure, observers were found to be capable of identifying the path within a field of randomly-oriented elements even when the spacing between the elements was considerably larger than the size of any of the individual elements. Furthermore, when the elements were oriented at angles up to +/- 60 deg relative to one another, the path was reliably identified. Alignment of the elements along the path was found to play a large role in the ability to detect the path. Small variations in the alignment or aligning the elements orthogonally (i.e. "side-to-side" as opposed to "end-to-end") significantly reduced the observer's ability to detect the presence of a path. The results are discussed in terms of an "association field" which integrates information across neighboring filters tuned to similar orientations. We suggest that some of the processes involved in texture segregation may have a similar explanation.},

	abstract = {Cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression have been extensively studied in primary visual cortex (V1). These two forms of suppression have some distinct properties which has led to the suggestion that they are generated by different underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, it has been suggested that mechanisms other than intracortical inhibition may be central to both forms of suppression. A simple computational model ({PC}/{BC}), in which intracortical inhibition is fundamental, is shown to simulate the distinct properties of cross-orientation and surround suppression. The same model has previously been shown to account for a large range of V1 response properties including orientation-tuning, spatial and temporal frequency tuning, facilitation and inhibition by flankers and textured surrounds as well as a range of other experimental results on cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression. The current results thus provide additional support for the {PC}/{BC} model of V1 and for the proposal that the diverse range of response properties observed in V1 neurons have a single computational explanation. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that current neurophysiological evidence is insufficient to discount intracortical inhibition as a central mechanism underlying both forms of suppression.

An appealing hypothesis is that these biases arise through a process of statistical inference, in which information from noisy measurements is fused with a probabilistic model of the environment. However, such inference is optimal only if the observer's internal model matches the environment. We found this to be the case. We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers' internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs. In addition, we determined how a neural population could embed probabilistic information responsible for such biases.},

	abstract = {Most vision research embracing the spatial frequency paradigm has been conceptually and mathematically a one-dimensional analysis of two-dimensional mechanisms. Spatial vision models and the experiments sustaining them have generally treated spatial frequency as a one-dimensional variable, even though receptive fields and retinal images are two-dimensional and linear transform theory obliges any frequency analysis to preserve dimension. Four models of cortical receptive fields are introduced and studied here in 2D form, in order to illustrate the relationship between their excitatory/inhibitory spatial structure and their resulting 2D spectral properties. It emerges that only a very special analytic class of receptive fields possess independent tuning functions for spatial frequency and orientation; namely, those profiles whose two-dimensional Fourier Transforms are expressible as the separable product of a radial function and an angular function. Furthermore, only such receptive fields would have the same orientation tuning curve for single bars as for gratings. All classes lacking this property would describe cells responsive to different orientations for different spatial frequencies and vice versa; this is shown to be the case, for example, for the Hubel \& Wiesel model of cortical orientation-tuned simple cells receiving inputs from an aligned row of center/surround {LGN} cells. When these results are considered in conjunction with psychophysical evidence for nonseparability of spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties within a ” channel”, it becomes mandatory that future spatial vision research of the Fourier genre take on an explicitly two-dimensional character.},

This notion, however, is based on assumptions that the noise distribution is independent among neurons and independent of the tuning curve width. Here we reexamine these assumptions in networks of spiking neurons by using orientation selectivity as an example. We compare two principal classes of model: one in which the tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral interactions, and one in which they are not. We report that sharpening through lateral interactions does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, leads to a severe loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models generate complicated codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our study generates several experimental predictions that can be used to distinguish between these two classes of model.},

Underlying this ability are contour grouping mechanisms that appropriately link local edge elements into global contours. Although a general view of how the brain achieves effective contour grouping has emerged, there have been a number of different specific proposals and few successes at quantitatively predicting performance. These previous proposals have been developed largely by intuition and computational trial and error. A more principled approach is to begin with an examination of the statistical properties of contours that exist in natural images, because it is these statistics that drove the evolution of the grouping mechanisms. Here we report measurements of both absolute and Bayesian edge co-occurrence statistics in natural images, as well as human performance for detecting natural-shaped contours in complex backgrounds. We find that contour detection performance is quantitatively predicted by a local grouping rule derived directly from the co-occurrence statistics, in combination with a very simple integration rule (a transitivity rule) that links the locally grouped contour elements into longer contours.},

The inference procedure is divided into two stages: a trace inference stage, which is the subject of the present work, and a curve synthesis stage. It is shown that recovery of the trace of a curve requires estimating local models for the curve at the same time, and that tangent and curvature information are sufficient. These make it possible to specify powerful constraints between estimated tangents to a curve, in terms of a neighborhood relationship called cocircularity, and between curvature estimates, in terms of a curvature consistency relation. Because all curve information is quantized, special care must be taken to obtain accurate estimates of trace points, tangents, and curvatures. This issue is addressed specifically to the introduction of a smoothness constraint and a maximum curvature constraint. The procedure is applied to two types of images: artificial images designed to evaluate curvature and noise sensitivity, and natural images},

Learning is found to be most pronounced in three Gabor function parameters representing the size and spatial frequency of the two-dimensional Gabor function and characterized by a nonuniform probability distribution with heavy tails. All three parameters are found to be strongly correlated, resulting in a basis of multiscale Gabor functions with similar aspect ratios and size-dependent spatial frequencies. A key finding is that the distribution of receptive-field sizes is scale invariant over a wide range of values, so there is no characteristic receptive field size selected by natural image statistics. The Gabor function aspect ratio is found to be approximately conserved by the learning rules and is therefore not well determined by natural image statistics. This allows for three distinct solutions: a basis of Gabor functions with sharp orientation resolution at the expense of spatial-frequency resolution, a basis of Gabor functions with sharp spatial-frequency resolution at the expense of orientation resolution, or a basis with unit aspect ratio. Arbitrary mixtures of all three cases are also possible. Two parameters controlling the shape of the marginal distributions in a probabilistic generative model fully account for all three solutions. The best-performing probabilistic generative model for sparse coding applications is found to be a gaussian copula with Pareto marginal probability density functions.},

One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

The joint distribution is then approximated to yield an analytical model of simple-cell receptive fields. Adapting a basis of Gabor functions is found to take an order of magnitude less computation than learning an equivalent non-parameterized basis. Derived learning rules are shown to be capable of adapting Gabor parameters to the statistics of images of man-made and natural environments. Learning is found to be most pronounced in three Gabor parameters that represent the size, aspect-ratio, and spatial frequency of the two-dimensional Gabor function. These three parameters are characterized by non-uniform marginal distributions with heavy tails – most likely due to scale invariance in natural images – and all three parameters are strongly correlated: resulting in a basis of multiscale Gabor functions with similar aspect-ratios, and size-dependent spatial frequencies. The Gabor orientation and phase parameters do not appear to gain anything from learning over natural images. Different tuning strategies are found by controlling learning through the Gabor parameter learning rates. Two opposing strategies include well-resolved orientation and well-resolved spatial frequency. On image reconstruction, a basis of Gabor functions with fitted marginal distributions is shown to significantly outperform a basis of Gabor functions generated from uniformly sampled parameters. An additional increase in performance results when the strong correlations are included. However, the best analytical model does not yet achieve the performance of the learned model. A comparison with estimates for biological simple cells shows that the Gabor function adapted to natural image statistics correctly predicts some key receptive field properties.},

	abstract = {To understand how the human visual system analyzes images, it is essential to know the structure of the visual environment. In particular, natural images display consistent statistical properties that distinguish them from random luminance distributions. We have studied the geometric regularities of oriented elements (edges or line segments) present in an ensemble of visual scenes, asking how much information the presence of a segment in a particular location of the visual scene carries about the presence of a second segment at different relative positions and orientations. We observed strong long-range correlations in the distribution of oriented segments that extend over the whole visual field. We further show that a very simple geometric rule, cocircularity, predicts the arrangement of segments in natural scenes, and that different geometrical arrangements show relevant differences in their scaling properties. Our results show similarities to geometric features of previous physiological and psychophysical studies. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of early vision.},

These properties result from the network of intrinsic cortical connections running across the cortical layers and between cortical columns. In the current study we relate the long receptive fields that are characteristic of layer 6 cells to the input that these cells receive from layer 5. The axons of layer 5 pyramidal cells project over long distances within layer 6, enabling layer 6 cells to collect input from regions of cortex representing large parts of the visual field. When layer 5 was locally inactivated by injection of the inhibitory transmitter {GABA}, layer 6 cells lost sensitivity over the portion of their receptive fields corresponding to the inactivated region of layer 5. This suggests that the extensive convergence in the projection from layer 5 to layer 6 is responsible for generating the long receptive fields characteristic of the layer 6 cells.},

Integrating spiking neural networks with robots introduces considerable complexity for questionable benefit if the objective is simply task performance. But, we suggest, in a cognitive robotics context, where the goal is understanding how to compute, such an approach may yield useful insights to neural architecture as well as learned behavior, especially if dedicated neural hardware is available. Recent advances in cognitive robotics and neuromorphic processing now make such systems possible. Using a scalable, structured, modular approach, we build a spiking neural network where the effects and impact of learning can be predicted and tested, and the network can be scaled or extended to new tasks automatically. We introduce several enhancements to a basic network and show how they can be used to direct performance toward behaviorally relevant goals. Results show that using a simple classical spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) rule on selected connections, we can get the robot (and network) to progress from poor task-specific performance to good performance. Behaviorally relevant {STDP} appears to contribute strongly to positive learning: “do this' but less to negative learning: "don't do that." In addition, we observe that the effect of structural enhancements tends to be cumulative. The overall system suggests that it is by being able to exploit combinations of effects, rather than any one effect or property in isolation, that spiking networks can achieve compelling, task-relevant behavior.},

These properties arise through interactions of orbitofrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices with the inferotemporal cortex, perirhinal cortex, parahippocampal cortices; ventral bank of the principal sulcus, ventral prearcuate gyrus, frontal eye fields, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, hypothalamus, and visual cortical areas V1, V2, V3A, V4, middle temporal cortex, medial superior temporal area, lateral intraparietal cortex, and posterior parietal cortex. Model explanations also include how the value of visual objects and events is computed, which objects and events cause desired consequences and which may be ignored as predictively irrelevant, and how to plan and act to realise these consequences, including how to selectively filter expected versus unexpected events, leading to movements towards, and conscious perception of, expected events. Modelled processes include reinforcement learning and incentive motivational learning; object and spatial working memory dynamics; and category learning, including the learning of object categories, value categories, object-value categories, and sequence categories, or list chunks.Conclusion:This article hereby proposes a unified neural theory of prefrontal cortex and its functions.},

Using it to simulate the random-dot-motion task, we demonstrate it quantitatively replicates the choice behaviour of monkeys, whilst predicting losses of otherwise usable information from {MT}. Its architecture maps to the recurrent cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops, whose components are all implicated in decision-making. We show that the dynamics of its mapped computations match those of neural activity in the sensorimotor cortex and striatum during decisions, and forecast those of basal ganglia output and thalamus. This also predicts which aspects of neural dynamics are and are not part of inference. Our single-equation algorithm is probabilistic, distributed, recursive, and parallel. Its success at capturing anatomy, behaviour, and electrophysiology suggests that the mechanism implemented by the brain has these same characteristics.},

	abstract = {The existence of a central fovea, the small retinal region with high analytical performance, is arguably the most prominent design feature of the primate visual system. This centralization comes along with the corresponding capability to move the eyes to reposition the fovea continuously. Past research on visual perception was mainly concerned with foveal vision while the observers kept their eyes stationary. Research on the role of eye movements in visual perception emphasized their negative aspects, for example, the active suppression of vision before and during the execution of saccades. But is the only benefit of our precise eye movement system to provide high acuity of the small foveal region, at the cost of retinal blur during their execution? In this review, I will compare human visual perception with and without saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements to emphasize different aspects and functions of eye movements. I will show that the interaction between eye movements and visual perception is optimized for the active sampling of information across the visual field and for the calibration of different parts of the visual field. The movements of our eyes and visual information uptake are intricately intertwined. The two processes interact to enable an optimal perception of the world, one that we cannot fully grasp by doing experiments where observers are fixating a small spot on a display.},

Cities have long been known to be society9s predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation, yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease. The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from patent production and personal income to electrical cable length are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling exponents, β, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities reflecting wealth creation and innovation have β ≈1.2 \&gt;1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure display β ≈0.8 \&lt;1 (economies of scale). We predict that the pace of social life in the city increases with population size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which β\&lt;1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Event-based cameras have recently drawn the attention of the Computer Vision community thanks to their advantages in terms of high temporal resolution, low power consumption and high dynamic range, compared to traditional frame-based cameras. These properties make event-based cameras an ideal choice for autonomous vehicles, robot navigation or {UAV} vision, among others. However, the accuracy of event-based object classiﬁcation algorithms, which is of crucial importance for any reliable system working in real-world conditions, is still far behind their framebased counterparts. Two main reasons for this performance gap are: 1. The lack of effective low-level representations and architectures for event-based object classiﬁcation and 2. The absence of large real-world event-based datasets. In this paper we address both problems. First, we introduce a novel event-based feature representation together with a new machine learning architecture. Compared to previous approaches, we use local memory units to efﬁciently leverage past temporal information and build a robust eventbased representation. Second, we release the ﬁrst large real-world event-based dataset for object classiﬁcation. We compare our method to the state-of-the-art with extensive experiments, showing better classiﬁcation performance and real-time computation.},

	abstract = {One of the key questions in neuroscience is how our brain self-organises to efficiently process information. To answer this question, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms of plasticity and their role in shaping synaptic connectivity. Theoretical neuroscience typically investigates plasticity on the level of neural networks. Neural network models often consist of point neurons, completely neglecting neuronal morphology for reasons of simplicity. However, during the past decades it became increasingly clear that inputs are locally processed in the dendrites before they reach the cell body. Dendritic properties enable local interactions between synapses and location-dependent modulations of inputs, rendering the position of synapses on dendrites highly important. These insights changed our view of neurons, such that we now think of them as small networks of nearly independent subunits instead of a simple point. Here, we propose that understanding how the brain processes information strongly requires that we consider the following properties: which plasticity mechanisms are present in the dendrites and how do they enable the self-organisation of synapses across the dendritic tree for efficient information processing? Ultimately, dendritic plasticity mechanisms can be studied in networks of neurons with dendrites, possibly uncovering unknown mechanisms that shape the connectivity in our brains.},

A crucial question is whether the behavior observed after training is part of the natural repertoire of the animal or represents an outlier in the animal's natural capabilities. This can be investigated by assessing the extent to which the target behavior is manifested during the initial stages of training and the time course of learning. We explored this issue by examining smooth pursuit eye movements in monkeys naïve to smooth pursuit tasks. We recorded the eye movements of monkeys from the first days of training on a step-ramp paradigm. We used bright spots, monkey pictures and scrambled versions of the pictures as moving targets. We found that during the initial stages of training, the pursuit initiation was largest for the monkey pictures and in some direction conditions close to target velocity. When the pursuit initiation was large, the monkeys mostly continued to track the target with smooth pursuit movements while correcting for displacement errors with small saccades. Two weeks of training increased the pursuit eye velocity in all stimulus conditions, whereas further extensive training enhanced pursuit slightly more. The training decreased the coefficient of variation of the eye velocity. Anisotropies that grade pursuit across directions were observed from the first day of training and mostly persisted across training. Thus, smooth pursuit in the step-ramp paradigm appears to be part of the natural repertoire of monkeys' behavior and training adjusts monkeys' natural predisposed behavior.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an unsupervised compact architecture that can extract features and classify the contents of dynamic scenes from the temporal output of a neuromorphic asynchronous event-based camera. Event-based cameras are clock-less sensors where each pixel asynchronously reports intensity changes encoded in time at the microsecond precision. While this technology is gaining more attention, there is still a lack of methodology and understanding of their temporal properties. This paper introduces an unsupervised time-oriented event-based machine learning algorithm building on the concept of hierarchy of temporal descriptors called time surfaces. In this work we show that the use of sparse coding allows for a very compact yet efficient time-based machine learning that lowers both the computational cost and memory need. We show that we can represent visual scene temporal dynamics with a finite set of elementary time surfaces while providing similar recognition rates as an uncompressed version by storing the most representative time surfaces using clustering techniques. Experiments will illustrate the main optimizations and trade-offs to consider when implementing the method for online continuous vs. offline learning. We report results on the same previously published 36 class character recognition task and a 4 class canonical dynamic card pip task, achieving 100\% accuracy on each.},

	title = {{RIFT}: Multi-modal Image Matching Based on Radiation-invariant Feature Transform},
	abstract = {Traditional feature matching methods such as scale-invariant feature transform ({SIFT}) usually use image intensity or gradient information to detect and describe feature points; however, both intensity and gradient are sensitive to nonlinear radiation distortions ({NRD}). To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel feature matching algorithm that is robust to large {NRD}. The proposed method is called radiation-invariant feature transform ({RIFT}). There are three main contributions in {RIFT}: first, {RIFT} uses phase congruency ({PC}) instead of image intensity for feature point detection. {RIFT} considers both the number and repeatability of feature points, and detects both corner points and edge points on the {PC} map. Second, {RIFT} originally proposes a maximum index map ({MIM}) for feature description. {MIM} is constructed from the log-Gabor convolution sequence and is much more robust to {NRD} than traditional gradient map. Thus, {RIFT} not only largely improves the stability of feature detection, but also overcomes the limitation of gradient information for feature description. Third, {RIFT} analyzes the inherent influence of rotations on the values of {MIM}, and realizes rotation invariance. We use six different types of multi-model image datasets to evaluate {RIFT}, including optical-optical, infrared-optical, synthetic aperture radar ({SAR})-optical, depth-optical, map-optical, and day-night datasets. Experimental results show that {RIFT} is much more superior to {SIFT} and {SAR}-{SIFT}. To the best of our knowledge, {RIFT} is the first feature matching algorithm that can achieve good performance on all the above-mentioned types of multi-model images. The source code of {RIFT} and multi-modal remote sensing image datasets are made public1.},

Here, we consider whether it is possible to distinguish between phenomenally transparent and opaque states in terms of active inference. We propose a relationship of phenomenal opacity to expected uncertainty or precision; i.e., the capacity for introspective attention and implicit mental action. Thus we associate introspective attention with the deployment of ‘precision’ that may render the perceptual evidence (for action) opaque, while treating transparency as a necessary aspect of beliefs about action, i.e., ‘what I am’ doing. We conclude by proposing how we may have to nuance our conception of minimal phenomenal selfhood and agency in light of this active inference conception of transparency-opacity.},

In doing this for neuroscience, we can learn lessons from long-standing practices in other areas of simulation (aircraft, computer chips), from software engineering, and from other biomedical disciplines. In this manuscript, we introduce some basic concepts that will be important in the development of credible clinical neuroscience models: reproducibility and replicability; verification and validation; model configuration; and procedures and processes for credible mechanistic multiscale modeling. We also discuss how garnering strong community involvement can promote model credibility. Finally, in addition to direct usage with patients, we note the potential for simulation usage in the area of Simulation-Based Medical Education, an area which to date has been primarily reliant on physical models (mannequins) and scenario-based simulations rather than on numerical simulations.},

The dominant framework to emerge has been image salience, where properties of the stimulus play a crucial role in guiding the eyes. However, salience-based schemes are poor at accounting for many aspects of picture viewing and can fail dramatically in the context of natural task performance. These failures have led to the development of new models of gaze allocation in scene viewing that address a number of these issues. However, models based on the picture-viewing paradigm are unlikely to generalize to a broader range of experimental contexts, because the stimulus context is limited, and the dynamic, task-driven nature of vision is not represented. We argue that there is a need to move away from this class of model and find the principles that govern gaze allocation in a broader range of settings. We outline the major limitations of salience-based selection schemes and highlight what we have learned from studies of gaze allocation in natural vision. Clear principles of selection are found across many instances of natural vision and these are not the principles that might be expected from picture-viewing studies. We discuss the emerging theoretical framework for gaze allocation on the basis of reward maximization and uncertainty reduction.},

Recovering a complete image is complicated by the fact that neural representations are noisy, high-dimensional, and contain incomplete information about image details. Thus, reconstructions of complex images from brain activity require a strong prior. Here we propose to train generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) to learn a generative model of images that is conditioned on measurements of brain activity. We consider two challenges of this approach: First, given that {GANs} require far more data to train than is typically collected in an {fMRI} experiment, how do we obtain enough samples to train a {GAN} that is conditioned on brain activity? Secondly, how do we ensure that our generated samples are robust against noise present in {fMRI} data? Our strategy to surmount both of these problems centers around the creation of surrogate brain activity samples that are generated by an encoding model. We find that the generative model thus trained generalizes to real {fRMI} data measured during perception of images and is able to reconstruct the basic outline of the stimuli.},

We address these questions by recording responses to natural movie stimuli with 32 channel silicon probes. By simultaneously recording from cells in all layers, and taking all recorded cells, we reduce recording bias that results from "hunting" for neural responses evoked from drifting bars and gratings. A nonparametric model reveals that many cells that are visually responsive do not appear to be captured by standard receptive field models. Using nonlinear Radial Basis Function kernels in a support vector machine, we can explain the responses of some of these cells better than standard linear and phase-invariant complex cell models. This suggests that V1 neurons exhibit more complex and diverse responses than standard models can capture, ranging from simple and complex cells strongly driven by their classical receptive fields, to cells with more nonlinear receptive fields inferred from the nonparametric and {RFB} model, and cells that are not visually responsive despite robust firing.},

Three types of models are compared: an Ising model which captures pairwise correlations between units, a Restricted Boltzmann Machine ({RBM}) which allows for modeling of higher-order correlations, and a semi-Restricted Boltzmann Machine which is a combination of Ising and {RBM} models. Model parameters were estimated in a fast and efficient manner using minimum probability flow, and log likelihoods were compared using annealed importance sampling. The higher-order models reveal localized activity patterns which reflect the laminar organization of neurons within a cortical column. The higher-order models also outperformed the Ising model in log-likelihood: On populations of 20 cells, the {RBM} had 10\% higher log-likelihood (relative to an independent model) than a pairwise model, increasing to 45\% gain in a larger network with 100 spatiotemporal elements, consisting of 10 neurons over 10 time steps. We further removed the need to model stimulus-induced correlations by incorporating a peri-stimulus time histogram term, in which case the higher order models continued to perform best. These results demonstrate the importance of higher-order interactions to describe the structure of correlated activity in cortical networks. Boltzmann Machines with hidden units provide a succinct and effective way to capture these dependencies without increasing the difficulty of model estimation and evaluation.},

More recently, the development of sparse multinomial logistic regression models has found application in text processing and microarray classiﬁcation, where explicit identiﬁcation of the most informative features is of value. In this paper, we propose a sparse multinomial logistic regression method, in which the sparsity arises from the use of a Laplace prior, but where the usual regularisation parameter is integrated out analytically. Evaluation over a range of benchmark datasets reveals this approach results in similar generalisation performance to that obtained using cross-validation, but at greatly reduced computational expense.},

Whether this orientation map has a function is currently debated, because many mammals, such as rodents, do not have such maps. Here we show that two fundamental properties of visual cortical responses, contrast saturation and cross-orientation suppression, are stronger within cat iso-orientation domains than at pinwheel centres. These differences develop when excitation (not normalization) from neighbouring oriented neurons is applied to different cortical orientation domains and then balanced by inhibition from un-oriented neurons. The functions of the pinwheel mosaic emerge from these local intra-cortical computations: Narrower tuning, greater cross-orientation suppression and higher contrast gain of iso-orientation cells facilitate extraction of object contours from images, whereas broader tuning, greater linearity and less suppression of pinwheel cells generate selectivity for surface patterns and textures.},

	shorttitle = {Multi-Layer Convolutional Sparse Modeling},
	abstract = {The recently proposed Multi-Layer Convolutional Sparse Coding ({ML}-{CSC}) model, consisting of a cascade of convolutional sparse layers, provides a new interpretation of Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}). Under this framework, the computation of the forward pass in a {CNN} is equivalent to a pursuit algorithm aiming to estimate the nested sparse representation vectors -- or feature maps -- from a given input signal. Despite having served as a pivotal connection between {CNNs} and sparse modeling, a deeper understanding of the {ML}-{CSC} is still lacking: there are no pursuit algorithms that can serve this model exactly, nor are there conditions to guarantee a non-empty model. While one can easily obtain signals that approximately satisfy the {ML}-{CSC} constraints, it remains unclear how to simply sample from the model and, more importantly, how one can train the convolutional filters from real data. In this work, we propose a sound pursuit algorithm for the {ML}-{CSC} model by adopting a projection approach. We provide new and improved bounds on the stability of the solution of such pursuit and we analyze different practical alternatives to implement this in practice. We show that the training of the filters is essential to allow for non-trivial signals in the model, and we derive an online algorithm to learn the dictionaries from real data, effectively resulting in cascaded sparse convolutional layers. Last, but not least, we demonstrate the applicability of the {ML}-{CSC} model for several applications in an unsupervised setting, providing competitive results. Our work represents a bridge between matrix factorization, sparse dictionary learning and sparse auto-encoders, and we analyze these connections in detail.},

	abstract = {Researchers have conjectured that eye movements during visual search are selected to minimize the number of saccades. The optimal Bayesian eye movement strategy minimizing saccades does not simply direct the eye to whichever location is judged most likely to contain the target but makes use of the entire retina as an information gathering device during each fixation. Here we show that human observers do not minimize the expected number of saccades in planning saccades in a simple visual search task composed of three tokens. In this task, the optimal eye movement strategy varied, depending on the spacing between tokens (in the first experiment) or the size of tokens (in the second experiment), and changed abruptly once the separation or size surpassed a critical value. None of our observers changed strategy as a function of separation or size. Human performance fell far short of ideal, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Vision is most sensitive to fine detail at the center of gaze (the fovea). We typically move our eyes several times a second to build up an accurate picture of the world around us and find objects of interest. Very recently, researchers have developed models of how a visual system like ours could search a scene for a specific target with the smallest possible number of eye fixations. In two experiments, we tested the assumptions underlying such models. We set up visual “games” in which observers were rewarded for their performance in moving their eyes once to recognize simple targets. To do well (earn the maximum possible reward), observers had to move their eyes according to the predictions of recent models of eye movement. We found that our observers failed to choose optimal eye movement strategies and failed to maximize their potential winnings. Our results suggest a simpler picture of eye movement selection, driven by a few simple heuristic rules that lead to good but not optimal performance in everyday tasks.},

Vergence eye movements are responsible for bringing the images of the two eyes into correspondence whereas saccades drive gaze to interesting regions in the scene. Control of both vergence and saccades develop during early infancy. To date, these two types of eye movements have been studied separately. Here we propose a computational model of an active vision system that integrates these two types of eye movements. We hypothesize that incorporating a saccade strategy driven by bottom-up attention will benefit the development of vergence control. The integrated system is based on the Active Efficient Coding framework, which describes the joint development of sensory processing and eye movement control to jointly optimize the coding efficiency of the sensory system. In the integrated system, we propose a binocular saliency model to drive saccades based on learned binocular feature extractors, which simultaneously encode both depth and texture information. Saliency in our model also depends on the current fixation point. This extends prior work, which focused on monocular images and saliency measures that are independent of the current fixation. Our results show that the proposed saliency driven saccades lead to better vergence performance and faster learning in the overall system than random saccades. Faster learning is significant because it indicates that the system actively selects inputs for the most effective learning. This work suggests that saliency driven saccades provide a scaffold for the development of vergence control during infancy.},

Eye movement statistics in humans are consistent with an optimal strategy. Journal of Vision, 8(3), 1–14. 4]; however, it seems unlikely that a biological nervous system would implement the computations for the Bayesian ideal ﬁxation selection because of their complexity. Here we derive and test a simple heuristic for optimal ﬁxation selection that appears to be a much better candidate for implementation within a biological nervous system. Speciﬁcally, we show that the near-optimal ﬁxation location is the maximum of the current posterior probability distribution for target location after the distribution is ﬁltered by (convolved with) the square of the retinotopic target detectability map. We term the model that uses this strategy the entropy limit minimization ({ELM}) searcher. We show that when constrained with human-like retinotopic map of target detectability and human search error rates, the {ELM} searcher performs as well as the Bayesian ideal searcher, and produces ﬁxation statistics similar to human.},

Here, we measure the association between citation rates and the Altmetric Attention Score—an indicator of the amount and reach of the attention an article has received—along with other forms of bibliometric performance (year published, journal impact factor, and article type). We found that Attention Score was positively correlated with citation rates. However, in recent years, we detected increasing media exposure did not relate to the equivalent citations as in earlier years; signalling a diminishing return on investment. Citations correlated with journal impact factors up to ∼13, but then plateaued, demonstrating that maximizing citations does not require publishing in the highest-impact journals. We conclude that ecology and conservation researchers can increase exposure of their research through social media engagement and, simultaneously, enhance their performance under traditional measures of scholarly activity.},

When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on {MNIST} and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

	abstract = {During normal viewing, the continuous stream of visual input is regularly interrupted, for instance by blinks of the eye. Despite these frequents blanks (that is the transient absence of a raw sensory source), the visual system is most often able to maintain a continuous representation of motion. For instance, it maintains the movement of the eye such as to stabilize the image of an object. This ability suggests the existence of a generic neural mechanism of motion extrapolation to deal with fragmented inputs. In this paper, we have modeled how the visual system may extrapolate the trajectory of an object during a blank using motion-based prediction. This implies that using a prior on the coherency of motion, the system may integrate previous motion information even in the absence of a stimulus. In order to compare with experimental results, we simulated tracking velocity responses. We found that the response of the motion integration process to a blanked trajectory pauses at the onset of the blank, but that it quickly recovers the information on the trajectory after reappearance. This is compatible with behavioral and neural observations on motion extrapolation. To understand these mechanisms, we have recorded the response of the model to a noisy stimulus. Crucially, we found that motion-based prediction acted at the global level as a gain control mechanism and that we could switch from a smooth regime to a binary tracking behavior where the dot is tracked or lost. Our results imply that a local prior implementing motion-based prediction is sufficient to explain a large range of neural and behavioral results at a more global level. We show that the tracking behavior deteriorates for sensory noise levels higher than a certain value, where motion coherency and predictability fail to hold longer. In particular, we found that motion-based prediction leads to the emergence of a tracking behavior only when enough information from the trajectory has been accumulated. Then, during tracking, trajectory estimation is robust to blanks even in the presence of relatively high levels of noise. Moreover, we found that tracking is necessary for motion extrapolation, this calls for further experimental work exploring the role of noise in motion extrapolation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29146465},
	abstract = {Injury to the primary visual cortex (V1, striate cortex) and the geniculostriate pathway in adults results in cortical blindness, abolishing conscious visual perception. Early studies by Larry Weiskrantz and colleagues demonstrated that some patients with an occipital-lobe injury exhibited a degree of unconscious vision and visually-guided behaviour within the blind field. A more recent focus has been the observed phenomenon whereby early-life injury to V1 often results in the preservation of visual perception in both monkeys and humans. These findings initiated a concerted effort on multiple fronts, including nonhuman primate studies, to uncover the neural substrate/s of the spared conscious vision. In both adult and early-life cases of V1 injury, evidence suggests the involvement of the Middle Temporal area ({MT}) of the extrastriate visual cortex, which is an integral component area of the dorsal stream and is also associated with visually-guided behaviors. Because of the limited number of early-life V1 injury cases for humans, the outstanding question in the field is what secondary visual pathways are responsible for this extraordinary capacity? Here we report for the first time a case of a child (B.I.) who suffered a bilateral occipital-lobe injury in the first two weeks postnatally due to medium-chain acyl-Co-A dehydrogenase deficiency. At 6 years of age, B.I. underwent a battery of neurophysiological tests, as well as structural and diffusion {MRI} and ophthalmic examination at 7 years. Despite the extensive bilateral occipital cortical damage, B.I. has extensive conscious visual abilities, is not blind, and can use vision to navigate his environment. Furthermore, unlike blindsight patients, he can readily and consciously identify happy and neutral faces and colors, tasks associated with ventral stream processing. These findings suggest significant re-routing of visual information. To identify the putative visual pathway/s responsible for this ability, {MRI} tractography of secondary visual pathways connecting {MT} with the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) and the inferior pulvinar ({PI}) were analysed. Results revealed an increased {PI}-{MT} pathway in the left hemisphere, suggesting that this pulvinar relay could be the neural pathway affording the preserved visual capacity following an early-life lesion of V1. These findings corroborate anatomical evidence from monkeys showing an enhanced {PI}-{MT} pathway following an early-life lesion of V1, compared to adults.},

Consequently, neurons responding to visual motion in a direction-selective way are found in almost all species that see. However, directional information is not explicitly encoded at the level of a single photoreceptor. Rather, it has to be computed from the spatio-temporal excitation level of at least two photoreceptors. How this computation is done and how this computation is implemented in terms of neural circuitry and membrane biophysics have remained the focus of intense research over many decades.

In this paper, we show that an association field of this type can be used to enhance the sparse representation of natural images. First, we define the {SparseLets} framework as an efficient representation of images based on a discrete wavelet transform. Second, we extract second-order information about edge co-occurrences from a set of images of natural scenes. Finally, we incorporate this prior information into our framework and show that it allows for the extraction of features relevant to natural scenes, like a round shape. This novel approach points the way to practical computer vision algorithms with human-like performance.},

	abstract = {Predictive processing ({PP}) approaches to the mind are increasingly popu-lar in the cognitive sciences. This surge of interest is accompanied by a proliferation of philosophical arguments, which seek to either extend or oppose various aspects of the emerging framework. In particular, the question of how to position predic-tive processing with respect to enactive and embodied cognition has become a topic of intense debate. While these arguments are certainly of valuable scientific and philosophical merit, they risk underestimating the variety of approaches gathered under the predictive label. Here, we first present a basic review of neuroscientific, cognitive, and philosophical approaches to {PP}, to illustrate how these range from solidly cognitivist applications—with a firm commitment to modular, internalistic mental representation—to more moderate views emphasizing the importance of 'body-representations', and finally to those which fit comfortably with radically enactive, embodied, and dynamic theories of mind. Any nascent predictive processing the-ory (e.g., of attention or consciousness) must take into account this continuum of views, and associated theoretical commitments. As a final point, we illustrate how the Free Energy Principle ({FEP}) attempts to dissolve tension between internalist and externalist accounts of cognition, by providing a formal synthetic account of how internal 'representations' arise from autopoietic self-organization. The {FEP} thus fur-nishes empirically productive process theories (e.g., predictive processing) by which to guide discovery through the formal modelling of the embodied mind.},

	abstract = {The function of smooth pursuit is to keep the fovea pointed at a small visual target that moves smoothly across a patterned background. Chemical lesions, single cell recordings, and behavioral measures have shown that the cortical motion processing pathways form the afferent limb for pursuit. Important areas include at least the striate cortex and the middle temporal visual area, and probably the medial superior temporal visual area and the posterior parietal cortex. We argue that the visual inputs are transmitted through a simple sensory motor interface in the pons, to the efferent limb in the brain stem and cerebellum. The efferent limb uses neural velocity memory to maintain pursuit automatically. We present evidence that the velocity memory is provided, at least in part, by eye velocity positive feedback between the flocculus of the cerebellum and the brain stem. Finally, we use a computer model to show how the maintenance of pursuit can be simulated on a millisecond time scale. The structure and internal elements of the model are based on the biological experiments reviewed in our paper. In the past five years, progress on the neural basis of pursuit eye movements has been rapid. Several areas of research have made substantial contributions, by using combinations of new and conventional methods. Many of the pathways that contribute to pursuit have been identified, and their physiological activity and functions are becoming understood. Continuing progress promises to yield an understanding of one specific form of visually guided movement, at the level of neuronal circuits and behavior, in the primate.},

It is shown that hippocampal spatial receptive fields show large and rapid anticipatory changes in their firing characteristics. These changes are experience- and environment-dependent and can be explained by a computational model based on {NMDA}-dependent synaptic plasticity during behavior. Striking similarities between the anticipatory network dynamics of widely different neural circuits, such as the hippocampus and primary visual cortex, are discussed.

	abstract = {{SpiNNaker} is a digital neuromorphic architecture, designed specifically for the low power simulation of large-scale spiking neural networks at speeds close to biological real-time. Unlike other neuromorphic systems, {SpiNNaker} allows users to develop their own neuron and synapse models as well as specify arbitrary connectivity. As a result {SpiNNaker} has proved to be a powerful tool for studying different neuron models as well as synaptic plasticity – believed to be one of the main mechanisms behind learning and memory in the brain. A number of Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity({STDP}) rules have already been implemented on {SpiNNaker} and have been shown to be capable of solving various learning tasks in real-time. However, while {STDP} is an important biological theory of learning, it is a form of Hebbian or unsupervised learning and therefore does not explain behaviours that depend on feedback from the environement. Instead, learning rules based on neuromodulated {STDP} (three-factor learning rules) have been shown to be capable of solving reinforcement learning tasks in a biologically plausible manner. In this paper we demonstrate for the first time how a model of three-factor {STDP}, with the third-factor representing spikes from dopaminergic neurons, can be implemented on the {SpiNNaker} neuromorphic system. Using this learning rule we first show how reward and punishment signals can be delivered to a single synapse before going on to demonstrate it in a larger network which solves the credit assignment problem in a Pavlovian conditioning experiment. Because of its extra complexity, we find that our three-factor learning rule requires approximately 2x as much processing time as the existing {SpiNNaker} {STDP} learning rules. However, we show that it is still possible to run our Pavlovian conditioning model with up to 10000 neurons in real-time, opening up new research opportunities for modelling behavioural learning on {SpiNNaker}.},

	abstract = {Predictive coding theories of sensory brain function interpret the hierarchical construction of the cerebral cortex as a Bayesian, generative model capable of predicting the sensory data consistent with any given percept. Predictions are fed backwards in the hierarchy and reciprocated by prediction error in the forward direction, acting to modify the representation of the outside world at increasing levels of abstraction, and so to optimize the nature of perception over a series of iterations. This accounts for many ‘illusory' instances of perception where what is seen (heard, etc) is unduly influenced by what is expected, based on past experience. This simple conception, the hierarchical exchange of prediction and prediction error, confronts a rich cortical microcircuitry that is yet to be fully documented. This article presents the view that, in the current state of theory and practice, it is profitable to begin a two-way exchange: that predictive coding theory can support an understanding of cortical microcircuit function, and prompt particular aspects of future investigation, whilst existing knowledge of microcircuitry can, in return, influence theoretical development. As an example, a neural inference arising from the earliest formulations of predictive coding is that the source populations of forwards and backwards pathways should be completely separate, given their functional distinction; this aspect of circuitry – that neurons with extrinsically bifurcating axons do not project in both directions – has only recently been confirmed. Here, the computational architecture prescribed by a generalized (free-energy) formulation of predictive coding is combined with the classic ‘canonical microcircuit' and the laminar architecture of hierarchical extrinsic connectivity to produce a template schematic, that is further examined in the light of (a) updates in the microcircuitry of primate visual cortex, and (b) rapid technical advances made possible by transgenic neural engineering in the mouse. The exercise highlights a number of recurring themes, amongst them the consideration of interneuron diversity as a spur to theoretical development and the potential for specifying a pyramidal neuron's function by its individual ‘connectome', combining its extrinsic projection (forward, backward or subcortical) with evaluation of its intrinsic network (e.g. unidirectional versus bidirectional connections with other pyramidal neurons).},

	abstract = {Direction-selective neurons in primary visual cortex have small receptive fields that encode the motions of local features. These motions often differ from the motion of the object to which they belong and must therefore be integrated elsewhere. A candidate site for this integration is visual cortical area {MT} (V5), in which cells with large receptive fields compute the motion of patterns. Previous studies of motion integration in {MT} have used stimuli that fill the receptive field, and thus do not test whether motion information is really integrated across this whole area. For each {MT} neuron, we identified two regions ("patches") within the receptive field that were approximately equally effective in driving responses. We then measured responses to plaids whose component gratings overlapped within a patch, and compared them with responses to the same component gratings presented in separate patches. Cells that were selective for the direction of motion of the whole pattern when the gratings overlapped lost this selectivity when the gratings were separated and became selective instead for the direction of motion of the individual components. If {MT} cells simply pooled all of the inputs that endow them with a receptive field, they would encode all of the motions in the receptive field as belonging to a single object. Our results indicate instead that critical elements of the computations underlying pattern-direction selectivity in {MT} are done locally, on a scale smaller than the whole receptive field.},

These methods usually fail to capture motion of objects with intensity evolution. We propose a new approach to solve the motion computation problem with a different type of constancy hypothesis. Because we are mainly interested in deformable moving structures, we postulate that such a structure, within a temporal image sequence, is associated with a constant volume or a constant total intensity over time. We call this postulate it the volume conservation hypothesis. Results are displayed for clouds motion and deformation on meteorological satellites images.},

This scheme provides a principled account of how people decide where to look, when categorising a visual scene based on its contents. In this paper, we use active inference to explain the visual searches of normal human subjects; enabling us to answer some key questions about visual foraging and salience attribution. First, we asked whether there is any evidence for 'epistemic foraging'; i.e. exploration that resolves uncertainty about a scene. In brief, we used Bayesian model comparison to compare Markov decision process ({MDP}) models of scan-paths that did-and did not-contain the epistemic, uncertainty-resolving imperatives for action selection. In the course of this model comparison, we discovered that it was necessary to include non-epistemic (heuristic) policies to explain observed behaviour (e.g., a reading-like strategy that involved scanning from left to right). Despite this use of heuristic policies, model comparison showed that there is substantial evidence for epistemic foraging in the visual exploration of even simple scenes. Second, we compared {MDP} models that did-and did not-allow for changes in prior expectations over successive blocks of the visual search paradigm. We found that implicit prior beliefs about the speed and accuracy of visual searches changed systematically with experience. Finally, we characterised intersubject variability in terms of subject-specific prior beliefs. Specifically, we used canonical correlation analysis to see if there were any mixtures of prior expectations that could predict between-subject differences in performance; thereby establishing a quantitative link between different behavioural phenotypes and Bayesian belief updating. We demonstrated that better scene categorisation performance is consistently associated with lower reliance on heuristics; i.e., a greater use of a generative model of the scene to direct its exploration.},

	abstract = {A full-rank matrix bf Ain {mathbbR} ntimes m with n{\textless}m generates an underdetermined system of linear equations bf Ax = bf b having infinitely many solutions. Suppose we seek the sparsest solution, i.e., the one with the fewest nonzero entries. Can it ever be unique? If so, when? As optimization of sparsity is combinatorial in nature, are there efficient methods for finding the sparsest solution? These questions have been answered positively and constructively in recent years, exposing a wide variety of surprising phenomena, in particular the existence of easily verifiable conditions under which optimally sparse solutions can be found by concrete, effective computational methods. Such theoretical results inspire a bold perspective on some important practical problems in signal and image processing. Several well-known signal and image processing problems can be cast as demanding solutions of undetermined systems of equations. Such problems have previously seemed, to many, intractable, but there is considerable evidence that these problems often have sparse solutions. Hence, advances in finding sparse solutions to underdetermined systems have energized research on such signal and image processing problems-to striking effect. In this paper we review the theoretical results on sparse solutions of linear systems, empirical results on sparse modeling of signals and images, and recent applications in inverse problems and compression in image processing. This work lies at the intersection of signal processing and applied mathematics, and arose initially from the wavelets and harmonic analysis research communities. The aim of this paper is to introduce a few key notions and applications connected to sparsity, targeting newcomers interested in either the mathematical aspects of this area or its applications.},

	abstract = {Ocular pursuit movements allow moving objects to be tracked with a combination of smooth movements and saccades. The principal objective is to maintain smooth eye velocity close to object velocity, thus minimising retinal image motion and maintaining acuity. Saccadic movements serve to realign the image if it falls outside the fovea, the area of highest acuity. Pursuit movements are often portrayed as voluntary but their basis lies in processes that sense retinal motion and can induce eye movements without active participation. The factor distinguishing pursuit from such reflexive movements is the ability to select and track a single object when presented with multiple stimuli. The selective process requires attention, which appears to raise the gain for the selected object and/or suppress that associated with other stimuli, the resulting competition often reducing pursuit velocity. Although pursuit is essentially a feedback process, delays in motion processing create problems of stability and speed of response. This is countered by predictive processes, probably operating through internal efference copy (extra-retinal) mechanisms using short-term memory to store velocity and timing information from prior stimulation. In response to constant velocity motion, the initial response is visually driven, but extra-retinal mechanisms rapidly take over and sustain pursuit. The same extra-retinal mechanisms may also be responsible for generating anticipatory smooth pursuit movements when past experience creates expectancy of impending object motion. Similar, but more complex, processes appear to operate during periodic pursuit, where partial trajectory information is stored and released in anticipation of expected future motion, thus minimising phase errors associated with motion processing delays.},

Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local 1D motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas 2D information takes pro- gressively over and leads to the final correct represen- tation of global motion. A Bayesian framework ac- counting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of ob- ject motion perception is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particu- larly the time course of its initiation phase. In addi- tion, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of 1D and 2D motion information.},

	abstract = {A fundamental problem in the generation of goal-directed behaviour is caused by the inevitable latency of biological sensory systems. Behaviour which is fully synchronised with the triggering sensory event can only be executed if the occurrence of this event can be predicted based on prior information. Smooth-pursuit eye movements are a classical and well-established example of goal-directed behaviour. The execution of these eye movements is thought to be very closely linked to the processing of visual motion signals. Here, we show that healthy human subjects as well as trained rhesus monkeys are able to initiate smooth-pursuit eye movements in anticipation of a moving target. These anticipatory pursuit eye movements are scaled to the velocity of the expected target. Furthermore, we can exclude the possibility that anticipatory pursuit is simply an after-pursuit of the previous trial. Visually-guided pursuit is only marginally affected by the presence of a structured background. However, the presence of a structured background severely impedes the ability to perform anticipatory pursuit. More generally, our data provide additional evidence that the cognitive oculomotor repertoires of human and monkeys are similar, at least with respect of smooth-pursuit in the prediction of an appearing target.},

Sensory-motor and motor circuits have both housekeeping and modulatory functions, implemented in the cerebellum and the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields. The representation of pursuit is quite different in these two regions of the brain, but both regions seem to control pursuit directly with little or no noise added downstream.

The reason why such a stereotyped relationship evolved is unknown. We propose that a fundamental constraint on the deployment of foveal vision lies in the motor system that is perturbed by signal-dependent noise (proportional noise) on the motor command. This noise imposes a compromise between the speed and accuracy of an eye movement. We propose that saccade trajectories have evolved to optimize a trade-off between the accuracy and duration of the movement. Taking a semi-analytical approach we use Pontryagin's minimum principle to show that there is an optimal trajectory for a given amplitude and duration; and that there is an optimal duration for a given amplitude. It follows that the peak velocity is also fixed for a given amplitude. These predictions are in good agreement with observed saccade trajectories and the main sequence. Moreover, this model predicts a small saccadic dead-zone in which it is better to stay eccentric of target than make a saccade onto target. We conclude that the main sequence has evolved as a strategy to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and speed.},

In addition to compensating for the perceptual-motor delay, these predictive processes perpetuate eye motion during a transient occlusion and compensate for the loss of visual input. At present, however, it is not well understood whether and how the oculomotor system extracts and represents target acceleration for subsequent predictive control. To this end, we used a target occlusion paradigm where both position and velocity of the target during the occlusion and at reappearance could not be predicted without extracting target acceleration before target disappearance. We found that the oculomotor response during the blanking period was not influenced by target acceleration when the initial exposure was 200 ms. However, smooth and saccadic eye movements did discriminate between the different levels of acceleration after an initial 500- or 800-ms exposure. In the event that the smooth response during the occlusion did not match well the target trajectory and thus eliminate a developing displacement error, there was an increased saccadic displacement. Still, the combined response during the blanking period did not eliminate retinal slip and position error at target reappearance.

	abstract = {Unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover the structure hidden in the data, and to learn representations that are more suitable as input to a supervised machine than the raw input. Many unsupervised methods are based on reconstructing the input from the representation, while constraining the representation to have cer-tain desirable properties (e.g. low dimension, sparsity, etc). Others are based on approximating density by stochastically reconstructing the input from the repre-sentation. We describe a novel and efficient algorithm to learn sparse represen-tations, and compare it theoretically and experimentally with a similar machine trained probabilistically, namely a Restricted Boltzmann Machine. We propose a simple criterion to compare and select different unsupervised machines based on the trade-off between the reconstruction error and the information content of the representation. We demonstrate this method by extracting features from a dataset of handwritten numerals, and from a dataset of natural image patches. We show that by stacking multiple levels of such machines and by training sequentially, high-order dependencies between the input observed variables can be captured.},

Although spatial-temporal sequences of brain activity often correlate with distance and duration measures, these correlations may not correspond to neuronal representations of space or time. Neither instruments nor brains sense space or time. Neuronal activity can be described as a succession of events without resorting to the concepts of space or time.

	abstract = {Pattern recognition is one of the most important tasks of the visual system, and uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying recognition phenomena has been a focus of researchers for decades. Surprisingly, at the earliest stages of vision, the retina is capable of highly sophisticated temporal pattern recognition. We stimulated the retina of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) with periodic dark flash sequences and found that retinal ganglion cells had a wide variety of different responses to a periodic flash sequence with many firing when a flash was omitted. The timing of the omitted stimulus response ({OSR}) depended on the period, with individual cells tracking the stimulus period down to increments of 5 ms. When flashes occurred earlier than expected, cells updated their expectation of the next flash time by as much as 50 ms. When flashes occurred later than expected, cells fired an {OSR} and reset their temporal expectation to the average time interval between flashes. Using pharmacology to investigate the retinal circuitry involved, we found that inhibitory transmission from amacrine cells was not required, but on bipolar cells were required. The results suggest a mechanism in which the intrinsic resonance of on bipolars leads to the {OSR} in ganglion cells. We discuss the implications of retinal pattern recognition on the neural code of the retina and visual processing in general.},

For several decades, the community has developed many software packages and simulators to accelerate research in computational neuroscience. In this article, we select the three most popular simulators, as determined by the number of models in the {ModelDB} database, such as {NEURON}, {GENESIS}, and {BRIAN}, and perform an independent evaluation of these simulators. In addition, we study {NEST}, one of the lead simulators of the Human Brain Project. First, we study them based on one of the most important characteristics, the range of supported models. Our investigation reveals that brain network simulators may be biased toward supporting a specific set of models. However, all simulators tend to expand the supported range of models by providing a universal environment for the computational study of individual neurons and brain networks. Next, our investigations on the characteristics of computational architecture and efficiency indicate that all simulators compile the most computationally intensive procedures into binary code, with the aim of maximizing their computational performance. However, not all simulators provide the simplest method for module development and/or guarantee efficient binary code. Third, a study of their amenability for high-performance computing reveals that {NEST} can almost transparently map an existing model on a cluster or multicore computer, while {NEURON} requires code modification if the model developed for a single computer has to be mapped on a computational cluster. Interestingly, parallelization is the weakest characteristic of {BRIAN}, which provides no support for cluster computations and limited support for multicore computers. Fourth, we identify the level of user support and frequency of usage for all simulators. Finally, we carry out an evaluation using two case studies: a large network with simplified neural and synaptic models and a small network with detailed models. These two case studies allow us to avoid any bias toward a particular software package. The results indicate that {BRIAN} provides the most concise language for both cases considered. Furthermore, as expected, {NEST} mostly favors large network models, while {NEURON} is better suited for detailed models. Overall, the case studies reinforce our general observation that simulators have a bias in the computational performance toward specific types of the brain network models.},

The nature of soft materials, however, presents considerable challenges to aspects of design, construction, and control – and up until now, the vast majority of gaits for soft robots have been hand-designed through empirical trial-and-error. This manuscript describes an easy-to-assemble tensegrity-based soft robot capable of highly dynamic locomotive gaits and demonstrating structural and behavioral resilience in the face of physical damage. Enabling this is the use of a machine learning algorithm able to discover novel gaits with a minimal number of physical trials. These results lend further credence to soft-robotic approaches that seek to harness the interaction of complex material dynamics in order to generate a wealth of dynamical behaviors.},

Moral choices are required, and the response of the third party depends on the reputation of the agent and the defector. The various options are so complex that some believe the human mind incapable of computing them in a reasonable time frame, and yet people make such choices easily. How can this be? Here the authors simulate choices faced by third parties in situations of indirect reciprocity and find that the choices that lead to the greatest cooperation needn't be the most complex. 'Stern judging', whereby 'all that matters is what you do and the reputation of your opponent when you act: help good people and refuse help otherwise, and we shall be nice to you; otherwise, you will be punished', is of merely second-order complexity, yet even pre-verbal infants use it.},

	abstract = {Early information processing deficits are consistently reported for patients with schizophrenia on smooth pursuit tracking tasks. A growing number of studies have applied a transient (magnocellular) or sustained (parvocellular) explanation to account for deficient processing of briefly presented visual stimuli, moving stimuli, and particularly, stimuli requiring smooth tracking eye movements in patients with schizophrenia. Although the preponderance of findings offer support for transient (where is it?) as opposed to sustained (what is it?) deficit, a need remains for specific depiction of the deficit. This was accomplished by applying a unique analytic method to a smooth pursuit tracking task. Fourteen patients with schizophrenia and fifteen normal control subjects were tested on smooth pursuit tracking performance at five different "within-wave" dot velocity frequencies that ranged from .3 to 1.1 hz. Performance data was extracted from each of the five frequencies and then separated into 12 discrete components that corresponded to light velocity (i.e., 12 bins). A repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that the performance of patients with schizophrenia was significantly poorer than that of their normal counterparts for three separate analyses of the time in smooth pursuit, F(11,594) = 8.99; p {\textless}0.00001, percentage of time in smooth pursuit, F(11,594) = 3.06; p {\textless}0.0005, and time in saccade eye movement, F(11,594) = 3.11; p {\textless}0.0004. A regression analysis revealed that the medication dosage was not significantly associated with performance on any of the critical measures, although trends were observed. The findings provide support for an early information processing deficit in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the results support the current neurophysiologic model for abnormal smooth pursuit tracking in patients with schizophrenia, specifically implicating a transient channel deficiency.},

We report the results of a study of smooth pursuit, reflexive and antisaccade performance in drug naive and antipsychotic treated first-episode schizophrenic patients. {METHODS}: Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements were recorded in 36 first-episode schizophrenic patients and 36 controls matched for age and estimated {IQ}. The schizophrenic patients were divided into drug-naive (N = 17) and antipsychotic treated groups (N = 19). {RESULTS}: Smooth pursuit velocity gain was significantly lower than controls only in the drug-naive patients. The treated patients did not differ significantly from either the controls or the untreated group. In an antisaccade paradigm both treated and drug-naive schizophrenic patients demonstrated an increased number of errors, but only drug-naive patients also demonstrated an increased latency in initiating correct antisaccades. {CONCLUSIONS}: These impairments are unlikely to be due to a generalized deficit in oculomotor function in the schizophrenic groups, as there were no differences between the groups in saccadic metrics on a reflexive saccade task. The results show that both smooth pursuit and saccadic abnormalities are present at the onset of schizophrenia and are integral to the disorder.},

	abstract = {The rise of large-scale recordings of neuronal activity has fueled the hope to gain new insights into the collective activity of neural ensembles. How can one link the statistics of neural population activity to underlying principles and theories? One attempt to interpret such data builds upon analogies to the behaviour of collective systems in statistical physics. Divergence of the specific heat-a measure of population statistics derived from thermodynamics-has been used to suggest that neural populations are optimized to operate at a "critical point". However, these findings have been challenged by theoretical studies which have shown that common inputs can lead to diverging specific heat. Here, we connect "signatures of criticality", and in particular the divergence of specific heat, back to statistics of neural population activity commonly studied in neural coding: firing rates and pairwise correlations. We show that the specific heat diverges whenever the average correlation strength does not depend on population size. This is necessarily true when data with correlations is randomly subsampled during the analysis process, irrespective of the detailed structure or origin of correlations. We also show how the characteristic shape of specific heat capacity curves depends on firing rates and correlations, using both analytically tractable models and numerical simulations of a canonical feed-forward population model. To analyze these simulations, we develop efficient methods for characterizing large-scale neural population activity with maximum entropy models. We find that, consistent with experimental findings, increases in firing rates and correlation directly lead to more pronounced signatures. Thus, previous reports of thermodynamical criticality in neural populations based on the analysis of specific heat can be explained by average firing rates and correlations, and are not indicative of an optimized coding strategy. We conclude that a reliable interpretation of statistical tests for theories of neural coding is possible only in reference to relevant ground-truth models.},

In this paper, we investigate the role of motion-based prediction in estimating motion trajectories compensating for delayed information sampling. In particular, we investigate how anisotropic diffusion of information may explain the development of anticipatory response as recorded in a neural populations to an approaching stimulus. We validate this using an abstract probabilistic framework and a spiking neural network ({SNN}) model. Inspired by a mechanism proposed by Nijhawan [1], we first use a Bayesian particle filter framework and introduce a diagonal motion-based prediction model which extrapolates the estimated response to a delayed stimulus in the direction of the trajectory. In the {SNN} implementation, we have used this pattern of anisotropic, recurrent connections between excitatory cells as mechanism for motion-extrapolation. Consistent with recent experimental data collected in extracellular recordings of macaque primary visual cortex [2], we have simulated different trajectory lengths and have explored how anticipatory responses may be dependent on the information accumulated along the trajectory. We show that both our probabilistic framework and the {SNN} model can replicate the experimental data qualitatively. Most importantly, we highlight requirements for the development of a trajectory-dependent anticipatory response, and in particular the anisotropic nature of the connectivity pattern which leads to the motion extrapolation mechanism.},

However, humans show highly stereotyped trajectories in which velocity profiles of both the eye and hand are smooth and symmetric for brief movements. Here we present a unifying theory of eye and arm movements based on the single physiological assumption that the neural control signals are corrupted by noise whose variance increases with the size of the control signal. We propose that in the presence of such signal-dependent noise, the shape of a trajectory is selected to minimize the variance of the final eye or arm position. This minimum-variance theory accurately predicts the trajectories of both saccades and arm movements and the speed-accuracy trade-off described by Fitt's law. These profiles are robust to changes in the dynamics of the eye or arm, as found empirically. Moreover, the relation between path curvature and hand velocity during drawing movements reproduces the empirical 'two-thirds power law. This theory provides a simple and powerful unifying perspective for both eye and arm movement control.},

While the question of how the visual system detects and senses motion energies at different spatial and temporal frequencies has been fairly well studied, it is unclear how the visual system integrates this information to form coherent percepts of object motion. We applied a combination of tailored psychophysical experiments and predictive modeling to address this question with regard to perceived motion in a given direction (i.e., stimulus speed). We tested human subjects in a discrimination experiment using stimuli that selectively targeted four distinct spatiotemporally tuned channels with center frequencies consistent with a common speed. We first characterized subjects' responses to stimuli that targeted only individual channels. Based on these measurements, we then predicted subjects' psychometric functions for stimuli that targeted multiple channels simultaneously. Specifically, we compared predictions of three Bayesian observer models that either optimally integrated the information across all spatiotemporal channels, or only used information from the most reliable channel, or formed an average percept across channels. Only the model with optimal integration was successful in accounting for the data. Furthermore, the proposed channel model provides an intuitive explanation for the previously reported spatial frequency dependence of perceived speed of coherent object motion. Finally, our findings indicate that a prior expectation for slow speeds is added to the inference process only after the sensory information is combined and integrated.},

	abstract = {Many large and small decisions we make in our daily lives-which ice cream to choose, what research projects to pursue, which partner to marry-require an exploration of alternatives before committing to and exploiting the benefits of a particular choice. Furthermore, many decisions require re-evaluation, and further exploration of alternatives, in the face of changing needs or circumstances. That is, often our decisions depend on a higher level choice: whether to exploit well known but possibly suboptimal alternatives or to explore risky but potentially more profitable ones. How adaptive agents choose between exploitation and exploration remains an important and open question that has received relatively limited attention in the behavioural and brain sciences. The choice could depend on a number of factors, including the familiarity of the environment, how quickly the environment is likely to change and the relative value of exploiting known sources of reward versus the cost of reducing uncertainty through exploration. There is no known generally optimal solution to the exploration versus exploitation problem, and a solution to the general case may indeed not be possible. However, there have been formal analyses of the optimal policy under constrained circumstances. There have also been specific suggestions of how humans and animals may respond to this problem under particular experimental conditions as well as proposals about the brain mechanisms involved. Here, we provide a brief review of this work, discuss how exploration and exploitation may be mediated in the brain and highlight some promising future directions for research.},

	abstract = {Neocortex contains a multitude of cell types segregated into layers and functionally distinct regions. To investigate the diversity of cell types across the mouse neocortex, we analyzed 12,714 cells from the primary visual cortex ({VISp}), and 9,035 cells from the anterior lateral motor cortex ({ALM}) by deep single-cell {RNA}-sequencing ({scRNA}-seq), identifying 116 transcriptomic cell types. These two regions represent distant poles of the neocortex and perform distinct functions. We define 50 inhibitory transcriptomic cell types, all of which are shared across both cortical regions. In contrast, 49 of 52 excitatory transcriptomic types were found in either {VISp} or {ALM}, with only three present in both. By combining single cell {RNA}-seq and retrograde labeling, we demonstrate correspondence between excitatory transcriptomic types and their region-specific long-range target specificity. This study establishes a combined transcriptomic and projectional taxonomy of cortical cell types from functionally distinct regions of the mouse cortex.},

Past research indicates that environmental variables may be represented as probabilistic distributions of a priori information (priors). Priors for environmental variables that do not change much over time have been widely studied. Little is known, however, about how priors develop in environments with nonstationary statistics. We examine whether humans change their reliance on the prior based on recent changes in environmental variance. Through experimentation, we obtain an online estimate of the human sensorimotor prior (prediction) and then compare it to similar online predictions made by various nonadaptive and adaptive models. Simulations show that models that rapidly adapt to nonstationary components in the environments predict the stimuli better than models that do not take the changing statistics of the environment into consideration. We found that adaptive models best predict participants' responses in most cases. However, we find no support for the idea that this is a consequence of increased reliance on recent experience just after the occurrence of a systematic change in the environment.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an active inference scheme for visual searches and the perceptual synthesis entailed by scene construction. Active inference assumes that perception and action minimise variational free energy, where actions are selected to minimise the free energy expected in the future. This assumption generalises risk-sensitive control and expected utility theory to include epistemic value; namely, the value (or salience) of information inherent in resolving uncertainty about the causes of ambiguous cues or outcomes. Here, we apply active inference to saccadic searches of a visual scene. We consider the (difficult) problem of categorising a scene, based on the spatial relationship among visual objects where, crucially, visual cues are sampled myopically through a sequence of saccadic eye movements. This means that evidence for competing hypotheses about the scene has to be accumulated sequentially, calling upon both prediction (planning) and postdiction (memory). Our aim is to highlight some simple but fundamental aspects of the requisite functional anatomy; namely, the link between approximate Bayesian inference under mean field assumptions and functional segregation in the visual cortex. This link rests upon the (neurobiologically plausible) process theory that accompanies the normative formulation of active inference for Markov decision processes. In future work, we hope to use this scheme to model empirical saccadic searches and identify the prior beliefs that underwrite intersubject variability in the way they forage for information in visual scenes (e.g., in schizophrenia).},

	abstract = {A central claim in modern network science is that real-world networks are typically "scale free," meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree $^{\textrm{-{\textbackslash}alpha\$}}$, often with \$2 {\textless} {\textbackslash}alpha {\textless} 3\$. However, empirical evidence for this belief derives from a relatively small number of real-world networks. We test the universality of scale-free structure by applying state-of-the-art statistical tools to a large corpus of nearly 1000 network data sets drawn from social, biological, technological, and informational sources. We fit the power-law model to each degree distribution, test its statistical plausibility, and compare it via a likelihood ratio test to alternative, non-scale-free models, e.g., the log-normal. Across domains, we find that scale-free networks are rare, with only 4\% exhibiting the strongest-possible evidence of scale-free structure and 52\% exhibiting the weakest-possible evidence. Furthermore, evidence of scale-free structure is not uniformly distributed across sources: social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks can be called strongly scale free. These results undermine the universality of scale-free networks and reveal that real-world networks exhibit a rich structural diversity that will likely require new ideas and mechanisms to explain.},

Current algorithms typically define a growth process with parameters that allow matching aspects of the morphologies. However, such algorithmic growth processes are far simpler than the biological ones. What is needed is an algorithm that, given a database of morphologies, produces more of those. Here, we introduce a generator for neuron morphologies that is based on a statistical sampling process. Our Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo ({RJMCMC}) method starts with a trivial neuron and iteratively perturbs the morphology bringing the features close to those of the database. By quantifying the statistics of the generated neurons, we find that it outperforms growth-based models for many features. Good generative models for neuron morphologies promise to be important both for neural simulations and for morphology reconstructions from imaging data.},

Velocity discrimination is also impaired and is correlated with pursuit initiation performance-suggesting that pursuit deficits are related to impairments in processing velocity information. Studies suggest that pursuit initiation is influenced by prior target motion information and/or expectations and that this is likely caused by expectation-based changes in the perceptual inputs to the pursuit system. We examined whether poor pursuit initiation in schizophrenia results from inaccurate encoding of immediate velocity signals, or whether these deficits reflect a failure to use prior target motion information to "optimize" the response. Twenty-eight patients and 24 controls performed an adapted version of a "remembered pursuit task." Trials consisted of a series of target motions, the first of which occurred unexpectedly, followed by four to seven identical targets each preceded by an auditory cue and a "catch target" in which a cue was given followed by target extinction. Initiation eye velocity in response to unexpected, first targets was similar in the patient and control groups. In contrast, patients showed lower eye velocity in response to repeated, cued targets compared with controls. Patients also showed reduced eye velocity in response to catch targets. Reduction in pursuit latency across repeated targets was less robust in patients. Results suggest that processing of immediate velocity information is unaffected in schizophrenia and that pursuit initiation deficits reflect an inability to accurately generate, store, and/or access "remembered" velocity signals.},

We recently reported that a population of fly neurons represents the animal's heading via bump-like activity dynamics. We combined two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed flying flies with optogenetics to overwrite the existing population representation with an artificial one, which was then maintained by the circuit with naturalistic dynamics. A network with local excitation and global inhibition enforces this unique and persistent heading representation.

We formalize (i) a statistical learning model, (ii) a parametric linking between the learning model's beliefs and infants' looking behavior, and (iii) a data analysis approach and model that infers parameters of the cognitive model and linking function for groups and individuals. Using this approach, we show that recent findings from Kidd, Piantadosi and Aslin (iv) of a U-shaped relationship between look-away probability and stimulus complexity even holds within infants and is not due to averaging subjects with different types of behavior.

In fact, it was recently shown show that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity, and raise the questions how neural circuits can maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously ongoing processes, and what functional uses these ongoing processes might have. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as Bayesian policy sampling.},

	abstract = {The goal of this thesis is to propose a novel video coding architecture which is inspired by the mammalian visual system and the retina. If one sees the retina as a machine which processes the visual stimulus, it seems an intelligent and very efficient model to mimic. There are several reasons to claim that, first of all because it consumes low power, it also deals with high resolution inputs and the dynamic way it transforms and encodes the visual stimulus is beyond the current standards. We were motivated to study and release a retina-inspired video codec. The proposed algorithm was applied to a video stream in a very simple way according to the coding standards like {MJPEG} or {MJPEG}2000. However, this way allows the reader to study and explore all the advantages of the retina dynamic processing way in terms of compression and image processing. The current performance of the retina-inspired codec is very promising according to some final results which outperform {MJPEG} for bitrates lo wer than 100 kbps and {MPEG}-2 for bitrates higher than 70 kpbs. In addition, for lower bitrates, the retina-inspired codec outlines better the content of the input scene. There are many perspectives which concern the improvement of the retina-inspired video codec which seem to lead to a groundbreaking compression architecture. Hopefully, this manuscript will be a useful tool for all the researchers who would like to study further than the perceptual capability of the mammalian visual system and understand how the structure and the functions of the retina can in practice improve the coding algorithms.},

	abstract = {Uncertainty is ubiquitous in our sensorimotor interactions, arising from factors such as sensory and motor noise and ambiguity about the environment. Setting it apart from previous theories, a quintessential property of the Bayesian framework for making inference about the state of world so as to select actions, is the requirement to represent the uncertainty associated with inferences in the form of probability distributions. In the context of sensorimotor control and learning, the Bayesian framework suggests that to respond optimally to environmental stimuli the central nervous system needs to construct estimates of the sensorimotor transformations, in the form of internal models, as well as represent the structure of the uncertainty in the inputs, outputs and in the transformations themselves. Here we review Bayesian inference and learning models that have been successful in demonstrating the sensitivity of the sensorimotor system to different forms of uncertainty as well as recent studies aimed at characterizing the representation of the uncertainty at different computational levels. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {How do neuronal populations represent concurrent stimuli? We measured population responses in cat primary visual cortex (V1) using electrode arrays. Population responses to two superimposed gratings were weighted sums of the individual grating responses. The weights depended strongly on the relative contrasts of the gratings. When the contrasts were similar, the population performed an approximately equal summation. When the contrasts differed markedly, however, the population performed approximately a winner-take-all competition. Stimuli that were intermediate to these extremes elicited intermediate responses. This entire range of behaviors was explained by a single model of contrast normalization. Normalization captured both the spike responses and the local field potential responses; it even predicted visually evoked currents source-localized to V1 in human subjects. Normalization has profound effects on V1 population responses and is likely to shape the interpretation of these responses by higher cortical areas. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As to the relay cells in cats' lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}), they also have weak but significant orientation bias ({OB}). It is thus of interest to investigate the fine spatiotemporal receptive field ({STRF}) properties in {LGN}, compare them with the dynamics of orientation tuning, and examine the dynamic relationship between {STRF} and orientation sensitivity in {LGN}. We mapped the {STRFs} of the {LGN} neurons in cats with white noise and characterized the dynamics of the orientation tuning by flashing gratings. We found that most of the {LGN} neurons showed elongated {RFs} and that the elongation axes were consistent with the preferred orientations. {STRFs} and the dynamics of orientation tuning were closely correlated temporally: the elongation of {RFs} and {OB} emerged, peaked and decayed at the same pace, with unchanged elongation axis of {RF} and preferred orientation but consistently changing aspect ratio of {RF} and {OB} strength across time. Importantly, the above consistency between {RF} and orientation tuning was not influenced by the ablation of the primary visual cortex. Furthermore, biased orientation tuning emerged 20–30 ms earlier than those in the primary visual cortex. These data demonstrated that similar to the primary visual cortex, the orientation sensitivity was closely reflected by the {RF} properties in {LGN}. However, the elongated {RF} and {OB} in {LGN} did not originate from the primary visual cortex feedback.},

	doi = {10.220.33.5},
	abstract = {1. We investigated cells in the middle temporal visual area ({MT}) and the medial superior temporal area ({MST}) that discharged during smooth pursuit of a dim target in an otherwise dark room. For each of these pursuit cells we determined whether the response during pursuit originated from visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target or from an extraretinal input related to the pursuit movement itself. We distinguished between these alternatives by removing the visual motion stimulus during pursuit either by blinking off the visual target briefly or by stabilizing the target on the retina. 2. In the foveal representation of {MT} ({MTf}), we found that pursuit cells usually decreased their rate of discharge during a blink or during stabilization of the visual target. The pursuit response of these cells depends on visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target. 3. In a dorsal-medial region of {MST} ({MSTd}), cells continued to respond during pursuit despite a blink or stabilization of the pursuit target. The pursuit response of these cells is dependent on an extraretinal input. 4. In a lateral-anterior region of {MST} ({MST}1), we found both types of pursuit cells; some, like those in {MTf}, were dependent on visual inputs whereas others, like those in {MSTd}, received an extraretinal input. 5. We observed a relationship between pursuit responses and passive visual responses. {MST} cells whose pursuit responses were attributable to extraretinal inputs tended to respond preferentially to large-field random-dot patterns. Some cells that preferred small spots also had an extraretinal input. 6. For 92\% of the pursuit cells we studied, the pursuit response began after onset of the pursuit eye movement. A visual response preceding onset of the eye movement could be observed in many of these cells if the initial motion of the target occurred within the visual receptive field of the cell and in its preferred direction. In contrast to the pursuit response, however, this visual response was not dependent on execution of the pursuit movement. 7. For the remaining 8\% of the pursuit cells, the pursuit discharge began before initiation of the pursuit eye movement. This occurred even though the initial motion of the target was outside the receptive field as mapped during fixation trials. Our data suggest, however, that such responses may be attributable to an expansion of the receptive field that accompanies enhanced visual responses.},

We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.},

	abstract = {A recurrent spiking neural network is proposed that implements planning as probabilistic inference for finite and infinite horizon tasks. The architecture splits this problem into two parts: The stochastic transient firing of the network embodies the dynamics of the planning task. With appropriate injected input this dynamics is shaped to generate high-reward state trajectories. A general class of reward- modulated plasticity rules for these afferent synapses is presented. The updates optimize the likelihood of getting a reward through a variant of an Expectation Maximization algorithm and learning is guaranteed to convergence to a local maximum. We find that the network dynamics are qualitatively similar to transient firing patterns during planning and foraging in the hippocampus of awake behaving rats. The model extends classical attractor models and provides a testable prediction on identifying modulating contextual information. In a real robot arm reaching and obstacle avoidance task the ability to represent multiple task solutions is investigated. The neural planning method with its local update rules provides the basis for future neuromorphic hardware implementations with promising potentials like large data processing abilities and early initiation of strategies to avoid dangerous situations in robot co-worker scenarios.},

Previous work considered the special case where D is an overcomplete system consisting of exactly two orthobases and has shown that, under a condition of mutual incoherence of the two bases, and assuming that S has a sufficiently sparse representation, this representation is unique and can be found by solving a convex optimization problem: specifically, minimizing the l(1) norm of the coefficients gamma. In this article, we obtain parallel results in a more general setting, where the dictionary D can arise from two or several bases, frames, or even less structured systems. We sketch three applications: separating linear features from planar ones in 3D data, noncooperative multiuser encoding, and identification of over-complete independent component models.},

Anticipation is strong if it arises from the system itself via lawful regularities embedded in the system's ordinary mode of functioning. The assumption of weak anticipation dominates cognitive science and neuroscience and in particular the study of perception and action. The assumption of strong anticipation, however, seems to be required by anticipation's ubiquity. It is, for example, characteristic of homeostatic processes at the level of the organism, organs, and cells. We develop the formal distinction between strong and weak anticipation by elaboration of anticipating synchronization, a phenomenon arising from time delays in appropriately coupled dynamical systems. The elaboration is conducted in respect to (a) strictly physical systems, (b) the defining features of circadian rhythms, often viewed as paradigmatic of biological behavior based in internal models, (c) Pavlovian learning, and (d) forward models in motor control. We identify the common thread of strongly anticipatory systems and argue for its significance in furthering understanding of notions such as "internal", "model" and "prediction".},

	abstract = {The link between anticipatory smooth eye movements and prediction in sinusoidal pursuit was investigated by presentation of series of identical, single-cycle, sinusoidal target motion stimuli. Stimuli occurred at randomized intervals (1.2-2.8 s) but were preceded by an audio warning cue 480 ms before each presentation. Cycle period (T) varied from 0.64 to 2.56 s and target displacement from 4 to 20 degrees in separate series. For T {\textless}/= 1.28 s, responses to the first stimulus of each series exhibited a time delay across the whole cycle (mean = 121 ms for T = 0.8 s). But, in the second and subsequent (steady-state) presentations, anticipatory movements, proportional to target velocity, were made and time delay was significantly reduced (mean = 43 ms for T = 0.8 s). Steady-state time delays were comparable to those evoked during continuous sinusoidal pursuit and less than pursuit reaction time. Even when subjects did not follow the target in the first presentation, they responded to the second presentation with reduced time delay. Throughout the experiments, three types of catch trial (A-C) were introduced. In A, the target failed to appear as expected after the warning cue. Anticipatory smooth movements were initiated, reaching a peak velocity proportional to prior target velocity around 200 ms after expected target onset. In B, the target stopped midway through the cycle. Even if the target remained on and was stationary, the eye movement continued to be driven away from the stationary target with a velocity similar to that of prior responses, reaching a peak velocity that was again proportional to expected target velocity after {\textgreater}/=205 ms. In C, the amplitude of the single sinusoid was unexpectedly increased or decreased. When it decreased, eye velocity throughout the first half-cycle of the response was close to that executed in response to prior stimuli of higher velocity and did not return to an appropriate level for 382-549 ms. Conversely, when amplitude increased, eye velocity remained inappropriately low for the first half-cycle. Results of A and C indicate that subjects are able to use velocity information stored from prior presentations to initiate an oculomotor drive that predominates over visual feedback for the first half-cycle. Results of B indicate that the second part of the cycle is also preprogrammed because it continued despite efforts to suppress it by fixation. The results suggest that initial retinal velocity error information can be sampled, stored, and subsequently replayed as a bi-directional anticipatory pattern of movement that reduces temporal delay and could account for predictive control during sinusoidal pursuit.},

	abstract = {Pursuing an object with smooth eye movements requires an accurate estimate of its two-dimensional (2D) trajectory. This 2D motion computation requires that different local motion measurements are extracted and combined to recover the global object-motion direction and speed. Several combination rules have been proposed such as vector averaging ({VA}), intersection of constraints ({IOC}), or 2D feature tracking (2DFT). To examine this computation, we investigated the time course of smooth pursuit eye movements driven by simple objects of different shapes. For type {II} diamond (where the direction of true object motion is dramatically different from the vector average of the 1-dimensional edge motions, i.e., {VA} not equal {IOC} = 2DFT), the ocular tracking is initiated in the vector average direction. Over a period of less than 300 ms, the eye-tracking direction converges on the true object motion. The reduction of the tracking error starts before the closing of the oculomotor loop. For type I diamonds (where the direction of true object motion is identical to the vector average direction, i.e., {VA} = {IOC} = 2DFT), there is no such bias. We quantified this effect by calculating the direction error between responses to types I and {II} and measuring its maximum value and time constant. At low contrast and high speeds, the initial bias in tracking direction is larger and takes longer to converge onto the actual object-motion direction. This effect is attenuated with the introduction of more 2D information to the extent that it was totally obliterated with a texture-filled type {II} diamond. These results suggest a flexible 2D computation for motion integration, which combines all available one-dimensional (edge) and 2D (feature) motion information to refine the estimate of object-motion direction over time.},

Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

	abstract = {According to a view that has dominated the field for over a century, the brain programs muscle commands and uses a copy of these commands [efference copy ({EC})] to adjust not only resulting motor action but also ongoing perception. This view was helpful in formulating several classical problems of action and perception: (1) the posture-movement problem of how movements away from a stable posture can be made without evoking resistance of posture-stabilizing mechanisms resulting from intrinsic muscle and reflex properties; (2) the problem of kinesthesia or why our sense of limb position is good despite ambiguous positional information delivered by proprioceptive and cutaneous signals; (3) the problem of visual space constancy or why the world is perceived as stable while its retinal image shifts following changes in gaze. On closer inspection, the {EC} theory actually does not solve these problems in a physiologically feasible way. Here solutions to these problems are proposed based on the advanced formulation of the equilibrium-point hypothesis that suggests that action and perception are accomplished in a common spatial frame of reference selected by the brain from a set of available frames. Experimental data suggest that the brain is also able to translate or/and rotate the selected frame of reference by modifying its major attributes-the origin, metrics and orientation-and thus substantially influence action and perception. Because of this ability, such frames are called physical to distinguish them from symbolic or mathematical frames that are used to describe system behavior without influencing this behavior. Experimental data also imply that once a frame of reference is chosen, its attributes are modified in a feedforward way, thus enabling the brain to act in an anticipatory and predictive manner. This approach is extended to sense of effort, kinesthetic illusions, phantom limb and phantom body phenomena. It also addresses the question of why retinal images of objects are sensed as objects located in the external, physical world, rather than in internal representations of the brain.},

Areas activated during occluded motion included the intraparietal sulcus ({IPS}) as well as middle temporal ({MT}) regions analogous to monkey {MT}/{MST}. A second experiment showed that these results were not due to motor activity. These findings suggest that human cortical regions involved in perceiving occluded motion are similar to regions that process real motion and regions responsible for eye movements.

Do we perceive the position of a moving object with a delay because of neuronal latencies? Or is there a brain mechanism that compensates for latencies such that we perceive the true position of a moving object in real time? This question has been intensely debated in the context of the flash-lag illusion: a moving object and an object flashed in alignment with it appear to occupy different positions. The moving object is seen ahead of the flash. Does this show that the visual system extrapolates the position of moving objects into the future to compensate for neuronal latencies? Alternative accounts propose that it simply shows that moving and flashed objects are processed with different delays, or that it reflects temporal integration in brain areas that encode position and motion. The flash-lag illusion and the hypotheses put forward to explain it lead to interesting questions about the encoding of position in the brain. Where is the 'where' pathway and how does it work?},

We have recorded from monkey posterior parietal cortex while the animal viewed a visual stimulus that disappeared, and then, depending on experimental context, could be inferred to be either moving or stationary. During this temporary absence of the stimulus, about half of the neurons were found to be significantly more active on those trials in which the stimulus could be presumed to be moving rather than stationary.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE} Computation in nervous systems operates with different computational primitives, and on different hardware, than traditional digital computation and is thus subjected to different constraints from its digital counterpart regarding the use of physical resources such as time, space and energy. In an effort to better understand neural computation on a physical medium with similar spatiotemporal and energetic constraints, the field of neuromorphic engineering aims to design and implement electronic systems that emulate in very large-scale integration ({VLSI}) hardware the organization and functions of neural systems at multiple levels of biological organization, from individual neurons up to large circuits and networks. Mixed analog/digital neuromorphic {VLSI} systems are compact, consume little power and operate in real time independently of the size and complexity of the model. {APPROACH} This article highlights the current efforts to interface neuromorphic systems with neural systems at multiple levels of biological organization, from the synaptic to the system level, and discusses the prospects for future biohybrid systems with neuromorphic circuits of greater complexity. {MAIN} {RESULTS} Single silicon neurons have been interfaced successfully with invertebrate and vertebrate neural networks. This approach allowed the investigation of neural properties that are inaccessible with traditional techniques while providing a realistic biological context not achievable with traditional numerical modeling methods. At the network level, populations of neurons are envisioned to communicate bidirectionally with neuromorphic processors of hundreds or thousands of silicon neurons. Recent work on brain-machine interfaces suggests that this is feasible with current neuromorphic technology. {SIGNIFICANCE} Biohybrid interfaces between biological neurons and {VLSI} neuromorphic systems of varying complexity have started to emerge in the literature. Primarily intended as a computational tool for investigating fundamental questions related to neural dynamics, the sophistication of current neuromorphic systems now allows direct interfaces with large neuronal networks and circuits, resulting in potentially interesting clinical applications for neuroengineering systems, neuroprosthetics and neurorehabilitation.},

However, this usually comes at the cost of reduced control over the dynamics of the emulated networks. In this paper, we demonstrate how iterative training of a hardware-emulated network can compensate for anomalies induced by the analog substrate. We first convert a deep neural network trained in software to a spiking network on the {BrainScaleS} wafer-scale neuromorphic system, thereby enabling an acceleration factor of 10 000 compared to the biological time domain. This mapping is followed by the in-the-loop training, where in each training step, the network activity is first recorded in hardware and then used to compute the parameter updates in software via backpropagation. An essential finding is that the parameter updates do not have to be precise, but only need to approximately follow the correct gradient, which simplifies the computation of updates. Using this approach, after only several tens of iterations, the spiking network shows an accuracy close to the ideal software-emulated prototype. The presented techniques show that deep spiking networks emulated on analog neuromorphic devices can attain good computational performance despite the inherent variations of the analog substrate.},

In the "flash-jump" illusion, a transient change in the appearance of a moving object (e.g., color) is mislocalized in the direction of subsequent motion. Finally, in the Frohlich illusion, the starting position of a suddenly appearing moving object is mislocalized in the direction of the subsequent motion. We demonstrate, in a series of experiments, a unified explanation for all these illusions: Perceptual localization is influenced by motion signals collected over approximately 80 ms after a query is triggered. These demonstrations rule out "latency difference" and asynchronous feature binding models, in which objects appear in their real positions but misaligned in time. Instead, the illusions explored here are best understood as biases in localization caused by motion signals. We suggest that motion biasing exists because it allows the visual system to account for neural processing delays by retrospectively "pushing" an object closer to its true physical location, and we propose directions for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dynamic updating of location by the activity of motion-sensitive neurons.},

To test the proposal that a predictive mechanism overcomes neural delays in vision by shifting objects spatially, we asked observers to judge the final position of a bar moving into the retinal blind spot. The bar was perceived to disappear in positions well inside the unstimulated area. Given that photoreceptors are absent in the blind spot, the perceived shift must be based on the history of the moving object. Such predictive overshoots are suppressed when a moving object disappears abruptly from the retina, triggering retinal transient signals.

	abstract = {Characterizing the functional connectivity between neurons is key for understanding brain function. We recorded spikes and local field potentials ({LFPs}) from multielectrode arrays implanted in monkey visual cortex to test the hypotheses that spikes generated outward-traveling {LFP} waves and the strength of functional connectivity depended on stimulus contrast, as described recently. These hypotheses were proposed based on the observation that the latency of the peak negativity of the spike-triggered {LFP} average ({STA}) increased with distance between the spike and {LFP} electrodes, and the magnitude of the {STA} negativity and the distance over which it was observed decreased with increasing stimulus contrast. Detailed analysis of the shape of the {STA}, however, revealed contributions from two distinct sources-a transient negativity in the {LFP} locked to the spike (∼0 ms) that attenuated rapidly with distance, and a low-frequency rhythm with peak negativity ∼25 ms after the spike that attenuated slowly with distance. The overall negative peak of the {LFP}, which combined both these components, shifted from ∼0 to ∼25 ms going from electrodes near the spike to electrodes far from the spike, giving an impression of a traveling wave, although the shift was fully explained by changing contributions from the two fixed components. The low-frequency rhythm was attenuated during stimulus presentations, decreasing the overall magnitude of the {STA}. These results highlight the importance of accounting for the network activity while using {STAs} to determine functional connectivity.},

	abstract = {We discuss how cybernetic principles of feedback control, used to explain sensorimotor behavior, can be extended to provide a foundation for understanding cognition. In particular, we describe behavior as parallel processes of competition and selection among potential action opportunities ('affordances') expressed at multiple levels of abstraction. Adaptive selection among currently available affordances is biased not only by predictions of their immediate outcomes and payoffs but also by predictions of what new affordances they will make available. This allows animals to purposively create new affordances that they can later exploit to achieve high-level goals, resulting in intentional action that links across multiple levels of control. Finally, we discuss how such a 'hierarchical affordance competition' process can be mapped to brain structure. Traditional assumptions of cognitive psychology are increasingly questioned by neurophysiology, casting doubt on the classic framework of serial information processing.For over 100 years there has existed an alternative framework, which describes behavior as a control system. Although originally applied to simple actions, it is increasingly being extended to address more sophisticated behavior, including intentional action.The brain's ability to predict the consequences of actions enables it to link across levels of abstraction, and to bias immediate actions by the predicted long-term opportunities they make possible - hence supporting intentional action.The organization of the brain, including the cerebral cortex, is increasingly viewed in terms of the species-typical activities that it evolved to support, as opposed to the hypothetical modules of cognitive psychology theory.},

Aiming to further improve the performance of these approaches, this paper presents a novel multi-spectral palmprint recognition approach based on oriented multiscale log-Gabor filters. The proposed method aims to enhance the recognition performances by proposing novel solutions at three stages of the recognition process. Inspired by the bitwise competitive coding, the feature extraction employs a multi-resolution log-Gabor filtering where the final feature map is composed of the winning codes of the lowest filters' bank response. The matching process employs a bitwise Hamming distance and Kullback–Leibler divergence as novel metrics to enable an efficient capture of the intra- and inter-similarities between palmprint feature maps. Finally, the decision stage is carried pout using a fusion of the scores generated from different spectral bands to reduce overlapping. In addition, a fusion of the feature maps through two proposed novel feature fusion techniques to allow us to eliminate the inherent redundancy of the features of neighboring spectral bands is also proposed. The experimental results obtained using the multi-spectral palmprint database {MS}-{PolyU} have shown that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in mono-spectral and multi-spectral recognition performances for both verification and identification modes; and also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

The spatiotemporal characteristics of the extrapolation can be quantitatively accounted for by a simple model based on temporally biphasic neuronal response, a property widely observed among sensory neurons. Thus, motion-induced perceptual extrapolation exists in human vision, and spatial blurring is an important factor in the interaction between motion and perceptual localization.},

It has been reproduced experimentally in retina and V1 along with some relevant evidences about motion based position coding in areas {MT} and {MT}+. Numerous hypotheses for mechanisms underlying {FLE} such as motion extrapolation, latency difference, position persistence, temporal averaging and postdiction have been under debate for last two decades. Here, we have challenged our previous motion-based prediction model to understand {FLE}, consistently with the motion extrapolation account proposed by Nijhawan. Our hypothesis is based on predictability of motion trajectory and importance of motion signal in manipulation of receptive field shape for moving objects. Using a probabilistic framework, we have implemented motion-based prediction ({MBP}) and simulated three different demonstrations of {FLE} including standard, flash initiated and flash terminated cycles. This method allowed us to compare the shape of the characteristic receptive fields for moving and stationary flashed dots in the case of rightward and leftward motions. As control model, we have eliminated velocity signal from motion estimation and simulated position-based ({PX}) model of {FLE}. Results of {MBP} model suggest that above a minimal time for duration of flash, the development of predictive component for the moving object is sufficient to shift in the direction of motion and to produce flash lag effect. {MBP} model reproduces experimental data of {FLE} and its dependence to the contrast of flash. Against what has been argued as shortage of motion extrapolation account, in our results spatial lead of moving object is also evident in flash initiated cycle. Our model, without being restricted to one special visual area, provides a generic account for {FLE} by emphasize on different manipulation of stationary objects and trajectory motion by the sensory system.},

	abstract = {We measured the spatial and temporal limits of directional interactions for 105 directionally selective middle temporal ({MT}) neurons and 26 directionally selective striate (V1) neurons. Directional interactions were measured using sequentially flashed stimuli in which the spatial and temporal intervals between stimuli were systematically varied over a broad range. A direction index was employed to determine the strength of directional interactions for each combination of spatial and temporal intervals tested. The maximum spatial interval for which directional interactions occurred in a particular neuron was positively correlated with receptive-field size and with retinal eccentricity in both {MT} and V1. The maximum spatial interval was, on average, three times as large in {MT} as in V1. The maximum temporal interval for which we obtained directional interactions was similar in {MT} and V1 and did not vary with receptive-field size or eccentricity. The maximum spatial interval for directional interactions as measured with flashed stimuli was positively correlated with the maximum speed of smooth motion that yielded directional responses. {MT} neurons were directionally selective for higher speeds than were V1 neurons. These observations indicate that the large receptive fields found in {MT} permit directional interactions over longer distances than do the more limited receptive fields of V1 neurons. A functional advantage is thereby conferred on {MT} neurons because they detect directional differences for higher speeds than do V1 neurons. Recent psychophysical studies have measured the spatial and temporal limits for the perception of apparent motion in sequentially flashed visual displays. A comparison of the psychophysical results with our physiological data indicates that the spatiotemporal limits for perception are similar to the limits for direction selectivity in {MT} neurons but differ markedly from those for V1 neurons. These observations suggest a correspondence between neuronal responses in {MT} and the short-range process of apparent motion.},

We examined how the magnitude of this misalignment changes near an abrupt change in velocity. The magnitude of the misalignment turns out to depend on the target's velocity after, rather than before, the flash. Thus, the misalignment cannot be caused by motion extrapolation. Neither can it be the inevitable consequence of a difference between the time it takes to process flashed and moving stimuli, because the magnitude of the misalignment is influenced by the extent to which subjects can anticipate the flash. We propose that it is the consequence of having to 'sample' the moving target's position in response to the flash. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Neural transmission latency would introduce a spatial lag when an object moves across the visual field, if the latency was not compensated. A visual predictive mechanism has been proposed, which overcomes such spatial lag by extrapolating the position of the moving object forward. However, a forward position shift is often absent if the object abruptly stops moving (motion-termination). A recent "correction-for-extrapolation" hypothesis suggests that the absence of forward shifts is caused by sensory signals representing 'failed' predictions. Thus far, this hypothesis has been tested only for extra-foveal retinal locations. We tested this hypothesis using two foveal scotomas: scotoma to dim light and scotoma to blue light. We found that the perceived position of a dim dot is extrapolated into the fovea during motion-termination. Next, we compared the perceived position shifts of a blue versus a green moving dot. As predicted the extrapolation at motion-termination was only found with the blue moving dot. The results provide new evidence for the correction-for-extrapolation hypothesis for the region with highest spatial acuity, the fovea.},

	abstract = {To perceive the relative positions of objects in the visual field, the visual system must assign locations to each stimulus. This assignment is determined by the object's retinal position, the direction of gaze, eye movements, and the motion of the object itself. Here we show that perceived location is also influenced by motion signals that originate in distant regions of the visual field. When a pair of stationary lines are flashed, straddling but not overlapping a rotating radial grating, the lines appear displaced in a direction consistent with that of the grating's motion, even when the lines are a substantial distance from the grating. The results indicate that motion's influence on position is not restricted to the moving object itself, and that even the positions of stationary objects are coded by mechanisms that receive input from motion-sensitive neurons.},

The position shift can be interpreted as a consequence of the motion aftereffect. For example, as the motion within a stationary aperture creates the impression that the aperture is shifted in position (De Valois \& De Valois, 1991; Hayes, 2000; Ramachandran \& Anstis, 1990), the motion aftereffect may generate a shift in perceived position of the test pattern simply because of the illusory motion it generates on the pattern. However, here we show a different aftereffect of motion adaptation that causes a shift in the apparent position of an object even when the object appears stationary and is located several degrees from the adapted region. This position aftereffect of motion reveals a new form of motion adaptation–one that does not result in a motion aftereffect–and suggests that motion and position signals are processed independently but then interact at a higher stage of processing.},

Anxiety disorders can be examined with reference to the behavior of individuals high in ‘trait' anxiety, which is a known vulnerability factor for the development of anxiety and mood disorders. However, it is not clear how this self-report measure relates to neural and behavioral processes captured by computational models. This paper reviews emerging computational approaches to the study of trait anxiety, specifying how interacting processes susceptible to analysis using computational models could drive a tendency to experience frequent anxious states and promote vulnerability to the development of clinical disorders.

	series = {{ECVP}},
	abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of simple cortical cells as 1) a linear transform representing edges and 2) a non-linear iterative stage of inhibition and facilitation between neighboring coefficients. The linear transform is a complex log-Gabor wavelet transform which is overcomplete (i.e. there are more coefficients than pixels in the image) and has exact reconstruction. The inhibition consists in diminishing down the coefficients which are not at a local-maxima along the direction normal to the edge filter orientation, whereas the facilitation enhances the collinear and co-aligned local-maximum coefficients. At each iteration and after the inhibition and facilitation stages, the reconstructed error is subtracted in the transform domain for keeping an exact reconstruction. Such process concentrates the signal energy on a few coefficients situated along the edges of the objects, yielding a sparse representation. The rationale for such procedure is: (1) th e overcompleteness offers flexibility for activity reassignment; (2) images can be coded by sparse Gabor coefficients located on object edges; (3) image contours produce aligned and collinear local-maxima in the transform domain; (4) the inhibition/facilitation processes are able to extract the contours. The sparse Gabor coefficients are mostly connected each other and located along object contours. Such layout makes chain coding suitable for compression purposes. Specially adapted to Gabor wavelets features, our chain coding represents every chain by its end-points (head and tail) and the elementary movements necessary to walk along the chain from head to tail. Moreover it predicts the module and phase of each Gabor coefficient according to the previous chain coefficient. As a result, redundancy of the transform domain is further reduced. Used for compression, the scheme limits particularly the high-frequency artifacts. The model performs also efficiently in tasks the Human Visual System is supposed to deal with, as for instance edge extraction and image denoising.},

	abstract = {Postulating that the brain performs approximate Bayesian inference generates principled and empirically testable models of neuronal function-the subject of much current interest in neuroscience and related disciplines. Current formulations address inference and learning under some assumed and particular model. In reality, organisms are often faced with an additional challenge-that of determining which model or models of their environment are the best for guiding behavior. Bayesian model averaging-which says that an agent should weight the predictions of different models according to their evidence-provides a principled way to solve this problem. Importantly, because model evidence is determined by both the accuracy and complexity of the model, optimal inference requires that these be traded off against one another. This means an agent's behavior should show an equivalent balance. We hypothesize that Bayesian model averaging plays an important role in cognition, given that it is both optimal and realizable within a plausible neuronal architecture. We outline model averaging and how it might be implemented, and then explore a number of implications for brain and behavior. In particular, we propose that model averaging can explain a number of apparently suboptimal phenomena within the framework of approximate (bounded) Bayesian inference, focusing particularly upon the relationship between goal-directed and habitual behavior.},

In addition to visually driven activity, there are neurons in visual cortex that integrate visual and motor-related input to signal a mismatch between actual and predicted visual flow. Here we show that these mismatch neurons have receptive fields and signal a local mismatch between actual and predicted visual flow in restricted regions of visual space. These mismatch receptive fields are aligned to the retinotopic map of visual cortex and are similar in size to visual receptive fields. Thus, neurons with mismatch receptive fields signal local deviations of actual visual flow from visual flow predicted based on self-motion and could therefore underlie the detection of objects moving relative to the visual flow caused by self-motion.

	abstract = {The term "minimal phenomenal selfhood" describes the basic, pre-reflective experience of being a self (Blanke \& Metzinger, 2009). Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of minimal phenomenal selfhood ({MPS}, Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reflective bodily processes. The free energy principle ({FEP}, Friston, 2010) is a novel unified theory of cortical function that builds upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the {FEP} via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the {FEP} in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness. We conclude that the conceptualization of {MPS} can be well mapped onto a hierarchical generative model furnished by the free energy principle and may constitute the basis for higher-level, cognitive forms of self-referral, as well as the understanding of other minds.},

	abstract = {Compressed sensing aims to undersample certain high-dimensional signals, yet accurately reconstruct them by exploiting signal characteristics. Accurate reconstruction is possible when the object to be recovered is sufficiently sparse in a known basis. Currently, the best known sparsity-undersampling tradeoff is achieved when reconstructing by convex optimization – which is expensive in important large-scale applications. Fast iterative thresholding algorithms have been intensively studied as alternatives to convex optimization for large-scale problems. Unfortunately known fast algorithms offer substantially worse sparsity-undersampling tradeoffs than convex optimization. We introduce a simple costless modification to iterative thresholding making the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff of the new algorithms equivalent to that of the corresponding convex optimization procedures. The new iterative-thresholding algorithms are inspired by belief propagation in graphical models. Our empirical measurements of the sparsity-undersampling tradeoff for the new algorithms agree with theoretical calculations. We show that a state evolution formalism correctly derives the true sparsity-undersampling tradeoff. There is a surprising agreement between earlier calculations based on random convex polytopes and this new, apparently very different theoretical formalism.},

Integration occurs both for stationary objects and moving objects, with very similar time constants (Burr, 1981). We measured, as a function of exposure duration, speed discrimination and ocular following performance for rich textured motion stimuli of varying spatial frequency bandwidth. Psychometric sensitivity and Oculometric sensitivity for these patterns increased with exposure duration. However the best stimuli for ocular following (namely those with a large bandwidth for spatial frequency) was well integrated up to about 150 - 200 msec, while the best stimuli for speed discrimination (small bandwidth) was well integrated up to about 300 msec. Interestingly, discriminability of ocular tracking eye movements follow a non-monotonic time course, due to the contribution of motor noise. These results suggest that although perception and action relies work in synergy, they may be described by two different integrating mechanisms: A low level, fast one guiding the ocular movement to enable one to catch stimuli in the visual fi eld quickly; and a slower one being able to measure the speed difference between two objects translating in the visual fi eld.

	title = {Learning Sparse Neural Networks through \$L\_0\$ Regularization},
	abstract = {We propose a practical method for \$L\_0\$ norm regularization for neural networks: pruning the network during training by encouraging weights to become exactly zero. Such regularization is interesting since (1) it can greatly speed up training and inference, and (2) it can improve generalization. {AIC} and {BIC}, well-known model selection criteria, are special cases of \$L\_0\$ regularization. However, since the \$L\_0\$ norm of weights is non-differentiable, we cannot incorporate it directly as a regularization term in the objective function. We propose a solution through the inclusion of a collection of non-negative stochastic gates, which collectively determine which weights to set to zero. We show that, somewhat surprisingly, for certain distributions over the gates, the expected \$L\_0\$ norm of the resulting gated weights is differentiable with respect to the distribution parameters. We further propose the {\textbackslash}emphhard concrete distribution for the gates, which is obtained by "stretching" a binary concrete distribution and then transforming its samples with a hard-sigmoid. The parameters of the distribution over the gates can then be jointly optimized with the original network parameters. As a result our method allows for straightforward and efficient learning of model structures with stochastic gradient descent and allows for conditional computation in a principled way. We perform various experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the resulting approach and regularizer.},

	abstract = {A recent optical imaging study of primary visual cortex (V1) by Basole, White, and Fitzpatrick demonstrated that maps of preferred orientation depend on the choice of stimuli used to measure them. These authors measured population responses expressed as a function of the optimal orientation of long drifting bars. They then varied bar length, direction, and speed and found that stimuli of a same orientation can elicit different population responses and stimuli with different orientation can elicit similar population responses. We asked whether these results can be explained from known properties of V1 receptive fields. We implemented an "energy model" where a receptive field integrates stimulus energy over a region of three-dimensional frequency space. The population of receptive fields defines a volume of visibility, which covers all orientations and a plausible range of spatial and temporal frequencies. This energy model correctly predicts the population response to bars of different length, direction, and speed and explains the observations made with optical imaging. The model also readily explains a related phenomenon, the appearance of motion streaks for fast-moving dots. We conclude that the energy model can be applied to activation maps of V1 and predicts phenomena that may otherwise appear to be surprising. These results indicate that maps obtained with optical imaging reflect the layout of neurons selective for stimulus energy, not for isolated stimulus features such as orientation, direction, and speed.},

	abstract = {Transmission of neural signals in the brain takes time due to the slow biological mechanisms that mediate it. During such delays, the position of moving objects can change substantially. The brain could use statistical regularities in the natural world to compensate neural delays and represent moving stimuli closer to real time. This possibility has been explored in the context of the flash lag illusion, where a briefly flashed stimulus in alignment with a moving one appears to lag behind the moving stimulus. Despite numerous psychophysical studies, the neural mechanisms underlying the flash lag illusion remain poorly understood, partly because it has never been studied electrophysiologically in behaving animals. Macaques are a prime model for such studies, but it is unknown if they perceive the illusion. By training monkeys to report their percepts unbiased by reward, we show that they indeed perceive the illusion qualitatively similar to humans. Importantly, the magnitude of the illusion is smaller in monkeys than in humans, but it increases linearly with the speed of the moving stimulus in both species. These results provide further evidence for the similarity of sensory information processing in macaques and humans and pave the way for detailed neurophysiological investigations of the flash lag illusion in behaving macaques.},

We characterized patterns of fixational eye movements made by observers staring at synthetic scenes either freely (i.e., free exploration) or during a symmetry orientation discrimination task (i.e., active exploration). Stimuli could be mirror-symmetric or not. Both free and active exploration generated more saccades parallel to the axis of symmetry than along other orientations. Most saccades were small ({\textless}2°), leaving the fovea within a 4° radius of fixation. Analysis of saccade dynamics showed that the observed parallel orientation selectivity emerged within 500 ms of stimulus onset and persisted throughout the trials under both viewing conditions. Symmetry strongly distorted existing anisotropies in gaze direction in a seemingly automatic process. We argue that this bias serves a functional role in which adjusted scene sampling enhances and maintains sustained sensitivity to local spatial correlations arising from symmetry.},

This conclusion is based on the following arguments: if the coupling among an ensemble of dynamical systems is mediated by short-range forces, then the states of remote systems must be conditionally independent. These independencies induce a Markov blanket that separates internal and external states in a statistical sense. The existence of a Markov blanket means that internal states will appear to minimize a free energy functional of the states of their Markov blanket. Crucially, this is the same quantity that is optimized in Bayesian inference. Therefore, the internal states (and their blanket) will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference. In other words, they will appear to model-and act on-their world to preserve their functional and structural integrity, leading to homoeostasis and a simple form of autopoiesis.},

	abstract = {This article is motivated by the formulation of biotic self-organisation in (Friston, 2013), where the emergence of ‘life' in coupled material entities (e.g., macromolecules) was predicated on bounded subsets that maintain a degree of statistical independence from the rest of the network. Boundary elements in such systems or units constitute a Markov blanket; separating the internal states of the unit from its surrounding states. In this paper, we ask whether Markov blankets operate in the nervous system and underlie the development of intelligence, enabling a progression from the ability to sense the environment to the ability to understand it. Markov blankets have been previously hypothesized to form in neuronal networks as a result of phase transitions that cause network subsets to fold into bounded assemblies, or packets (Yufik, 1998a). The ensuing neuronal packets hypothesis builds on the notion of neuronal assemblies (Hebb, 1949, 1980), treating such assemblies as flexible but stable biophysical structures capable of withstanding entropic erosion. In other words, structures that maintain their integrity under changing conditions. In this treatment, neuronal packets give rise to perception of 'objects'; i.e., quasi-stable (stimulus bound) groupings that are conserved over multiple presentations (e.g., the experience of perceiving ‘apple' can be interrupted and resumed many times). Monitoring the variations in such groups enables the apprehension of behaviour; i.e., attributing to objects the ability to undergo changes without loss of self-identity. Ultimately, ‘understanding' involves self-directed composition and manipulation of the ensuing ‘mental models' that are constituted by neuronal packets, whose dynamics capture relationships among objects: that is, dependencies in the behaviour of objects under varying conditions. For example, movement is known to involve rotation of population vectors in the motor cortex (Georgopoulos et al, 1993; Georgopoulos et al, 1988). The neuronal packet hypothesis associates ‘understanding' with the ability to detect and generate coordinated rotation of population vectors – in neuronal packets –in associative cortex and other regions in the brain. The ability to coordinate vector representations in this way is assumed to have developed in conjunction with the ability to postpone overt motor expression of implicit movement, thus creating a mechanism for prediction},

If the object is unfamiliar to us, our first movement will exhibit an error, producing a trajectory that is different from the one we had intended. This experience of error initiates learning in our brain, making it so that on the very next attempt our motor commands partially compensate for the unfamiliar physics, resulting in smaller errors. With further practice, the compensation becomes more complete, and our brain forms a model that predicts the physics of the object. This model is a motor memory that frees us from having to relearn the physics the next time that we encounter the object. The mechanism by which the brain transforms sensory prediction errors into corrective motor commands is the basis for how we learn the physics of objects with which we interact. The cerebellum and the motor cortex appear to be critical for our ability to learn physics, allowing us to use tools that extend our capabilities, making us masters of our environment.},

While sparse coding has become an increasingly popular method for learning visual features, it is most often trained at the patch level. Applying the resulting filters convolutionally results in highly redundant codes because overlapping patches are encoded in isolation. By training convolutionally over large image windows, our method reduces the redudancy between feature vectors at neighboring locations and improves the efficiency of the overall repre-sentation. In addition to a linear decoder that reconstructs the image from sparse features, our method trains an efficient feed-forward encoder that predicts quasi-sparse features from the input. While patch-based training rarely produces any-thing but oriented edge detectors, we show that convolutional training produces highly diverse filters, including center-surround filters, corner detectors, cross de-tectors, and oriented grating detectors. We show that using these filters in multi-stage convolutional network architecture improves performance on a number of visual recognition and detection tasks.},

	abstract = {This article is about how the brain data mines its sensory inputs. There are several architectural principles of functional brain anatomy that have emerged from careful anatomic and physiologic studies over the past century. These principles are considered in the light of representational learning to see if they could have been predicted a priori on the basis of purely theoretical considerations. We first review the organisation of hierarchical sensory cortices, paying special attention to the distinction between forward and backward connections. We then review various approaches to representational learning as special cases of generative models, starting with supervised learning and ending with learning based upon empirical Bayes. The latter predicts many features, such as a hierarchical cortical system, prevalent top-down backward influences and functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections that are seen in the real brain. The key points made in article are: (i). hierarchical generative models enable the learning of empirical priors and eschew prior assumptions about the causes of sensory input that are inherent in non-hierarchical models. These assumptions are necessary for learning schemes based on information theory and efficient or sparse coding, but are not necessary in a hierarchical context. Critically, the anatomical infrastructure that may implement generative models in the brain is hierarchical. Furthermore, learning based on empirical Bayes can proceed in a biologically plausible way. (ii). The second point is that backward connections are essential if the processes generating inputs cannot be inverted, or the inversion cannot be parameterised. Because these processes involve many-to-one mappings, are non-linear and dynamic in nature, they are generally non-invertible. This enforces an explicit parameterisation of generative models (i.e. backward connections) to afford recognition and suggests that forward architectures, on their own, are not sufficient for perception. (iii). Finally, non-linearities in generative models, mediated by backward connections, require these connections to be modulatory, so that representations in higher cortical levels can interact to predict responses in lower levels. This is important in relation to functional asymmetries in forward and backward connections that have been demonstrated empirically.},

On each day, the monkeys saw 2 new icons (small pictures) and learned which one was relevant. We rewarded eye movements to a saccade target connected to the relevant icon with a curve. Neurons in visual and frontal cortex coded the monkey's choice, because the representation of the selected curve was enhanced. Learning delayed the neuronal selection signals and we uncovered the cause of this delay in V1, where learning to select the relevant icon caused an early suppression of surrounding image elements. These results demonstrate that the learning of a new rule causes a transition from fast and random decisions to a more considerate strategy that takes additional time and they reveal the contribution of visual and frontal cortex to the learning process.},

	abstract = {Understanding how organisms establish their form during embryogenesis and regeneration represents a major knowledge gap in biological pattern formation. It has been recently suggested that morphogenesis could be understood in terms of cellular information processing and the ability of cell groups to model shape. Here, we offer a proof of principle that self-assembly is an emergent property of cells that share a common (genetic and epigenetic) model of organismal form. This behaviour is formulated in terms of variational free-energy minimization-of the sort that has been used to explain action and perception in neuroscience. In brief, casting the minimization of thermodynamic free energy in terms of variational free energy allows one to interpret (the dynamics of) a system as inferring the causes of its inputs-and acting to resolve uncertainty about those causes. This novel perspective on the coordination of migration and differentiation of cells suggests an interpretation of genetic codes as parametrizing a generative model-predicting the signals sensed by cells in the target morphology-and epigenetic processes as the subsequent inversion of that model. This theoretical formulation may complement bottom-up strategies-that currently focus on molecular pathways-with (constructivist) top-down approaches that have proved themselves in neuroscience and cybernetics.},

	abstract = {An object moving in discrete steps can appear to move continuously even along sections of the path in which no stimulus is presented. We investigated whether the internal representation of such an object is constructed by extrapolation, along the expected trajectory of the object, or by interpolation, after the subsequent reappearance of the object. Observers viewed two discs moving in an unambiguous apparent motion display, which either occasionally reversed direction or continued moving along the predicted path. Observers carried out a speeded 2AFC task on probes presented between the possible disc locations. In the continuous condition, observers' reaction times to detect and identify a probe were longer when it occurred ahead of the disc than when it occurred elsewhere on the motion path. Conversely, when the disc reversed direction, significantly less interference was observed ahead of the disc (along the predicted motion path), and significantly more interference was observed behind the disc (along the updated motion path). We conclude that the representation of a moving object in an apparent motion display is constructed by interpolation as well as extrapolation. We demonstrate that this representation is maintained and updated even outside the locus of focused attention, and that it is possible to dissociate the contributions of interpolation and extrapolation mechanisms to an object's representation.},

Neurophysiological studies suggest that such sequences fulfill functions in memory consolidation, augmentation of representations, internal simulation, and recombination of acquired information. Using computational modeling, we propose that internally generated sequences may be productively considered a component of goal-directed decision systems, implementing a sampling-based inference engine that optimizes goal acquisition at multiple timescales of on-line choice, action control, and learning.},

Due to an upper limit on the number of incoming connections of a single neuron, network connectivity becomes extremely sparse at this scale. To manage computational costs, simulation software ultimately targeting the brain scale needs to fully exploit this sparsity. Here we present a two-tier connection infrastructure and a framework for directed communication among compute nodes accounting for the sparsity of brain-scale networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing the technology in the {NEST} simulation code and we investigate its performance in different scaling scenarios of typical network simulations. Our results show that the new data structures and communication scheme prepare the simulation kernel for post-petascale high-performance computing facilities without sacrificing performance in smaller systems.},

	abstract = {Neural conduction delay is a serious issue for organisms that need to act in real time. Various forms of flash-lag effect ({FLE}) suggest that the nervous system may perform extrapolation to compensate for delay. For example, in motion {FLE}, the position of a moving object is perceived to be ahead of a brief flash when they are actually colocalized. However, the precise mechanism for extrapolation at a single-neuron level has not been fully investigated. Our hypothesis is that facilitating synapses, with their dynamic sensitivity to the rate of change in the input, can serve as a neural basis for extrapolation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed and tested models of facilitating dynamics. First, we derived a spiking neuron model of facilitating dynamics at a single-neuron level, and tested it in the luminance {FLE} domain. Second, the spiking neuron model was extended to include multiple neurons and spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}), and was tested with orientation {FLE}. The results showed a strong relationship between delay compensation, {FLE}, and facilitating synapses/{STDP}. The results are expected to shed new light on real time and predictive processing in the brain, at the single neuron level.},

It is believed that this is implemented in cortical areas by elementary inferential computations dynamically extracting the most likely parameters corresponding to the sensory signal. We explore here a neuro-mimetic feed-forward model of the primary visual area ({VI}) solving this problem in the case where the signal may be described by a robust linear generative model. This model uses an over-complete dictionary of primitives which provides a distributed probabilistic representation of input features. Relying on an efficiency criterion, we derive an algorithm as an approximate solution which uses incremental greedy inference processes. This algorithm is similar to 'Matching Pursuit' and mimics the parallel architecture of neural computations. We propose here a simple implementation using a network of spiking integrate-and-fire neurons which communicate using lateral interactions. Numerical simulations show that this Sparse Spike Coding strategy provides an efficient model for representing visual data from a set of natural images. Even though it is simplistic, this transformation of spatial data into a spatio-temporal pattern of binary events provides an accurate description of some complex neural patterns observed in the spiking activity of biological neural networks.},

A network model consisting of interacting excitatory and inhibitory cell populations coding for stimulus position is used to study the neuronal population response to a continuously moving stimulus. An adaptation mechanism is proposed that offers the possibility to control and modulate motion-induced extrapolation without changing the spatial interaction structure within the network. Using an occluder paradigm, functional advantages of an internally generated model of a moving stimulus are discussed. It is shown that the integration of such a model in processing leads to a faster and more reliable recognition of the input stream and allows for object permanence following occlusion.

Our results showed that discounting the influences from V4 markedly reduced V1 lateral interactions, indicating dependence on feedback signals of the effective connectivity within V1. On the other hand, the feedback influences were reciprocally dependent on V1 lateral interactions because the modulation strengths from V4 to V1 were greatly reduced after discounting the influences from other V1 neurons. Our findings suggest that feedback and lateral connections closely interact to mediate image grouping and segmentation.},

	abstract = {Integration of continuous-time dynamics in a spiking neural network simulator Hahne et al. Abstract Contemporary modeling approaches to the dynamics of neural networks consider two main classes of mod-els: biologically grounded spiking neurons and functionally inspired rate-based units. The unified simulation framework presented here supports the combination of the two for multi-scale modeling approaches, the quan-titative validation of mean-field approaches by spiking network simulations, and an increase in reliability by usage of the same simulation code and the same network model specifications for both model classes. While most efficient spiking simulations rely on the communication of discrete events, rate models require time-continuous interactions between neurons. Exploiting the conceptual similarity to the inclusion of gap junctions in spiking network simulations, we arrive at a reference implementation of instantaneous and delayed interac-tions between rate-based models in a spiking network simulator. The separation of rate dynamics from the general connection and communication infrastructure ensures flexibility of the framework. We further demon-strate the broad applicability of the framework by considering various examples from the literature ranging from random networks to neural field models. The study provides the prerequisite for interactions between rate-based and spiking models in a joint simulation.},

	abstract = {The quality of the representation of an object's motion is limited by the noise in the sensory input as well as by an intrinsic ambiguity due to the spatial limi- tation of the visual motion analyzers (aperture prob- lem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local 1D motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas 2D information takes pro- gressively over and leads to the final correct represen- tation of global motion. A Bayesian framework ac- counting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of ob- ject motion perception is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particu- larly the time course of its initiation phase. In addi- tion, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of 1D and 2D motion information.},

Consistent with this general function, intracortical microstimulation ({ICMS}) in the {PM} of sufficient frequency, amplitude, and duration has been shown to evoke complex movements of the arm and hand that vary systematically depending on the locus of stimulation. Using frequencies and amplitudes too low to evoke muscle activity, however, we found that {ICMS} in the {PM} can provide instructions to perform specific reach, grasp, and manipulate movements. These instructed actions were not fixed but rather were learned through associations between the arbitrary stimulation locations and particular movements. Low-amplitude {ICMS} at different {PM} locations thus evokes distinguishable experiences that can become associated with specific movements arbitrarily, providing a novel means of injecting information into the nervous system.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Co-familial traits have higher recurrence risk rates than schizophrenia itself and might serve as pointers to the underlying physiology of schizophrenic illness. A dysfunction of smooth pursuit eye movements is one such co-familial trait that occurs in about 40 to 80\% of schizophrenic patients and about 25 to 40\% of their first degree relatives. The eye movement abnormality appears only when the subject tracks a moving target. We have traced this abnormality to a deficit in velocity sensitivity, a function that is regulated by a specific central nervous system network that includes the middle temporal and medial superior temporal areas of the extra-striate cortex. The higher familial recurrence risk of abnormal eye tracking, compared with that of clinical schizophrenia (about 5 to 8\%), suggests that schizophrenic psychosis may be the rare form of a more prevalent disorder whose symptoms are much milder and more benign than the cognitive and behavioral disturbances of the clinical psychosis. From this vantage point, abnormal eye tracking can be viewed as one pleiotropic manifestation of schizophrenia, considered broadly, just as the café-au-lait spots of neurofibromatosis are a more benign and more frequent manifestation of that disease than are the neurofibromata.},

	abstract = {1. In four human subjects, we measured the latency of saccadic eye movements made to a second, eccentric target after an initial, foveated target was extinguished. In separate interleaved trails, the targets were either both stationary ("fixation") or both moving with the same velocity ("pursuit"). For both fixation and pursuit trials, we extinguished the first target at randomized times during maintained fixation or pursuit and varied the time interval ("gap duration") before the appearance of the second target. 2. During both fixation and pursuit, the presence of a 200-ms gap reduced the latencies of saccades, compared with those obtained with no gap. For two subjects, we imposed additional, intermediate gap durations and found that saccade latencies varied as a function of gap duration. Furthermore, the latencies of saccades elicited during pursuit displayed the same dependence on gap duration as those elicited during fixation. 3. Our results demonstrate that the "gap effect" observed for saccades made during fixation also occurs for saccades made during pursuit. To the extent that the gap effect on saccade latency reflects a mechanism underlying the release of fixation, our results suggest that the same mechanism is invoked for saccades made during pursuit. From the viewpoint of initiating saccades, the existence of separate fixation and pursuit systems may be irrelevant.},

	abstract = {Inhibition in thalamorecipient layer 4 simple cells of primary visual cortex is believed to play important roles in establishing visual response properties and integrating visual inputs across their receptive fields ({RFs}). Simple cell {RFs} are characterized by nonoverlapping, spatially restricted subregions in which visual stimuli can either increase or decrease the firing rate of the cell, depending on contrast. Inhibition is believed to be triggered exclusively from visual stimulation of individual {RF} subregions. However, this view is at odds with the known anatomy of layer 4 interneurons in visual cortex and differs from recent findings in mouse visual cortex. Here we show with in vivo intracellular recordings in cats that while excitation is restricted to {RF} subregions, inhibition spans the width of simple cell {RFs}. Consequently, excitatory stimuli within a subregion concomitantly drive excitation and inhibition. Furthermore, we found that the distribution of inhibition across the {RF} is stronger toward {OFF} subregions. This inhibitory {OFF}-subregion bias has a functional consequence on spatial integration of inputs across the {RF}. A model based on the known anatomy of layer 4 demonstrates that the known proportion and connectivity of inhibitory neurons in layer 4 of primary visual cortex is sufficient to explain broad inhibition with an {OFF}-subregion bias while generating a variety of phase relations, including antiphase, between excitation and inhibition in response to drifting gratings.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} The wiring of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits is key to determining the response properties in sensory cortex. In the visual cortex, the first cells that receive visual input are simple cells in layer 4. The underlying circuitry responsible for the response properties of simple cells is not yet known. In this study, we challenge a long-held view concerning the pattern of inhibitory input and provide results that agree with current known anatomy. We show here that inhibition is evoked broadly across the receptive fields of simple cells, and we identify a surprising bias in inhibition within the receptive field. Our findings represent a step toward a unified view of inhibition across different species and sensory systems.},

In vivo, noise correlations tend to be positive and proportional to the similarity in tuning properties. Such correlations are thought to limit information, which has led to the suggestion that decorrelation increases information. In contrast, we found, analytically and numerically, that decorrelation does not imply an increase in information. Instead, the only information-limiting correlations are what we refer to as differential correlations: correlations proportional to the product of the derivatives of the tuning curves. Unfortunately, differential correlations are likely to be very small and buried under correlations that do not limit information, making them particularly difficult to detect. We found, however, that the effect of differential correlations on information can be detected with relatively simple decoders.},

	abstract = {The information theory developed by Shannon was designed to place a quantitative measure on the amount of information involved in any communication. The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us. In this paper the theory of the value of information that arises from considering jointly the probabilistic and economic factors that affect decisions is discussed and illustrated. It is found that numerical values can be assigned to the elimination or reduction of any uncertainty. Furthermore, it is seen that the joint elimination of the uncertainty about a number of even independent factors in a problem can have a value that differs from the sum of the values of eliminating the uncertainty in each factor separately.},

However, how the motor system is sculpted by trial-by-trial content of current sensory information remains largely unexplored. Previous work suggests that conditional probabilities, learned under a particular context, can be used preemptively to influence the output of the motor system [11-14]. To test this we used transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) to read out corticospinal excitability ({CSE}) during preparation for action in an instructed delay task [15, 16]. We systematically varied the uncertainty about an impending action by changing the validity of the instructive visual cue. We used two information-theoretic quantities to predict changes in {CSE}, prior to action, on a trial-by-trial basis: entropy (average uncertainty) and surprise (the stimulus-bound information conveyed by a visual cue) [17-19]. Our data show that during preparation for action, human {CSE} varies according to the entropy and surprise conveyed by visual events guiding action. {CSE} increases on trials with low entropy about the impending action and low surprise conveyed by an event. Commensurate effects were observed in reaction times. We suggest that motor output is biased according to contextual probabilities that are represented dynamically in the brain.},

The models utilize a learnt pointwise nonlinear transform of the stimulus, followed by a linear filter that acts on the sequence of transformed inputs. In one case, the nonlinear transform is the same at all filter lag-times. Thus, this "input nonlinearity" converts the initial numerical representation of stimulus value to a new representation that provides optimal input to the subsequent linear model. We describe algorithms that estimate both the input nonlinearity and the linear weights simultaneously; and present techniques to regularise and quantify uncertainty in the estimates. In a second approach, the model is generalized to allow a different nonlinear transform of the stimulus value at each lag-time. Although more general, this model is algorithmically more straightforward to fit. However, it has many more degrees of freedom than the first approach, thus requiring more data for accurate estimation. We test the feasibility of these methods on synthetic data, and on responses from a neuron in rodent barrel cortex. The models are shown to predict responses to novel data accurately, and to recover several important neuronal response properties.},

The proposed imaging system has many advantages, but the illumination of the microcamera image is nonuniform. The edge illumination of the microcamera image is low that makes it difficult to the subsequent image data processing. We analyze the illumination of the image theoretically and propose to use the relative illumination factor to compensate the low illumination region in corresponding fields. Finally, a specific microcamera is designed by using {ZEMAX} software and the illumination of the microcamera image is optimized by the proposed method, realizing the uniform illumination of the image.},

It has applications in areas such as texture segmentation, shape classification and analysis of medical images. Several approaches can be used for calculating the fractal dimension of digital images; the most popular method is the box-counting method. It is also very challenging and difficult to classify patterns in high resolution computed tomography images ({HRCT}) using this important descriptor. This paper applied the Holder exponent computation of the local intensity values for detecting the emphysema patterns in {HRCT} images. The absolute differences between the normal and the abnormal regions in the images are the key for a successful classification of emphysema patterns using the statistical analysis. The results obtained in this paper demonstrated the effectiveness of the predictive power of the features extracted from the Holder exponent in the analysis and classification of {HRCT} images. The overall classification accuracy achieved in lung tissue layers is greater than 90\%, which is an evidence to prove the effectiveness of the methods investigated in this paper.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

However, how do we evaluate percepts generated in the absence of direct input that are, therefore, completely unreliable? Here, we utilize the phenomenon of filling-in occurring at the physiological blind-spots to compare partially inferred and veridical percepts. Subjects chose between stimuli that elicit filling-in, and perceptually equivalent ones presented outside the blind-spots, looking for a Gabor stimulus without a small orthogonal inset. In ambiguous conditions, when the stimuli were physically identical and the inset was absent in both, subjects behaved opposite to optimal, preferring the blind-spot stimulus as the better example of a collinear stimulus, even though no relevant veridical information was available. Thus, a percept that is partially inferred is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. In other words: Humans treat filled-in inferred percepts as more real than veridical ones.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {During the course of pursuing a moving target there are often periods of transient disappearance as it moves behind objects and surfaces. In experimental settings, eye velocity decays rapidly on the extinction of a moving target. However, eye velocity does not decay to zero if there is an expectation the target will reappear further along its trajectory. Increasing eye velocity to coincide with target reappearance could minimize the developing velocity error, but it remains to be empirically verified whether this can be achieved. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of stimulus predictability, target velocity, and interstimulus interval ({ISI}) on ocular pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target. We confirmed that subjects (n = 9) did not maintain eye velocity close to target velocity for the duration of the {ISI}. In general, after an initial reduction in eye velocity the majority of subjects (n = 7) exhibited a significant increase before target reappearance. The timing of the velocity increase was not influenced by target velocity, stimulus predictability, or {ISI}. Consequently, for the 900-ms {ISI} the increase occurred too early and the eye was decelerating at the moment of target reappearance. These results are consistent with a reduction in gain being applied to the visuomotor drive when the target disappeared, followed by a reactivation in expectation of target reappearance. We modeled this process such that gain was modulated within a reafferent feedback system, hence preserving its output in the absence of negative visual feedback and enabling an anticipatory increase in eye velocity before expected target reappearance.},

The way our visual system deals with this complexity has remained controversial in the literature. Some models claim that the ventral pathway, a set of visual cortical areas responsible for object recognition, can process only one or very few objects at a time without ambiguity. Other models argue in favor of a massively parallel processing of objects in a scene. Recent experiments in monkeys have provided important data about this issue. The ventral pathway seems to be able to perform complex analyses on several objects simultaneously, but only during a short time period. Subsequently only one or very few objects are explicitly selected and consciously perceived.

We fit this cascade model to responses of individual {MT} neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in {MT}. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

Excitation and inhibition dynamically balance each other, with inhibition lagging excitation by only few milliseconds. To characterize the functional consequences of such correlated excitation and inhibition, we studied models in which this correlation structure is induced by feedforward inhibition ({FFI}). Simple circuits show that an effective {FFI} changes the integrative behavior of neurons such that only synchronous inputs can elicit spikes, causing the responses to be sparse and precise. Further, effective {FFI} increases the selectivity for propagation of synchrony through a feedforward network, thereby increasing the stability to background activity. Last, we show that recurrent random networks with effective inhibition are more likely to exhibit dynamical network activity states as have been observed in vivo. Thus, when a feedforward signal path is embedded in such recurrent network, the stabilizing effect of effective inhibition creates an suitable substrate for signal propagation. In conclusion, correlated excitation and inhibition support the notion that synchronous spiking may be important for cortical processing.},

Simulations reveal a stable asynchronous irregular ground state with heterogeneous activity across areas, layers, and populations. Elicited by large-scale interactions, the model reproduces longer intrinsic time scales in higher compared to early visual areas. Activity propagates down the visual hierarchy, similar to experimental results associated with visual imagery. Cortico-cortical interaction patterns agree well with {fMRI} resting-state functional connectivity. The model bridges the gap between local and large-scale accounts of cortex, and clarifies how the detailed connectivity of cortex shapes its dynamics on multiple scales.},

This ensures that agents sample the environment to maximise the evidence for their model of the world, such that exchanges with the environment are predictable and adaptive. However, the free energy account does not invoke reward or cost-functions from reinforcement-learning and optimal control theory. We therefore ask whether reward is necessary to explain adaptive behaviour. The free energy formulation uses ideas from statistical physics to explain action in terms of minimising sensory surprise. Conversely, reinforcement-learning has its roots in behaviourism and engineering and assumes that agents optimise a policy to maximise future reward. This paper tries to connect the two formulations and concludes that optimal policies correspond to empirical priors on the trajectories of hidden environmental states, which compel agents to seek out the (valuable) states they expect to encounter.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Although much is known about volitional and reflexive smooth eye movements individually, much less is known about how they are coordinated. It is hypothesized that separate cortico-ponto-cerebellar loops subserve these different types of smooth eye movements. Specifically, the {MT}-{MST}-{DLPN} pathway is thought to be critical for ocular following eye movements, whereas the {FEF}-{NRTP} pathway is understood to be vital for volitional smooth pursuit. However, the role that these loops play in combined volitional and reflexive behavior is unknown. We used a large, textured background moving in conjunction with a small target spot to investigate the eye movements evoked by a combined volitional and reflexive pursuit task. We also assessed the activity of neurons in the smooth eye movement subregion of the frontal eye field ({FEFsem}). We hypothesized that the pursuit system would show less contribution from the volitional pathway in this task, owing to the increased involvement of the reflexive pathway. In accordance with this hypothesis, a majority of {FEFsem} neurons (63\%) were less active during pursuit maintenance in a combined volitional and reflexive pursuit task than during purely volitional pursuit. Interestingly and surprisingly, the neuronal response to the addition of the large-field motion was highly correlated with the neuronal response to a target blink. This suggests that {FEFsem} neuronal responses to these different perturbations—whether the addition or subtraction of retinal input—may be related. We conjecture that these findings are due to changing weights of both the volitional and reflexive pathways, as well as retinal and extraretinal signals.},

It is an offence for the attacker to be in an offside position and in active play at the moment a fellow team member plays the ball. Assistant referees often make mistakes when judging an offside offence, probably because of optical errors arising from the viewing angle adopted by them (Oudejans, Verheijen, Bakker, Gerrits, Steinbrückner, Beek, 2000 Nature 404 33). Looking more closely at Oudejans et al's data, we show evidence that the flash-lag effect may contribute significantly to these mistakes.

We tracked participants' eye movements while they judged whether one billiard ball caused another one to go through a gate or prevented it from going through. Both participants' looking patterns and their judgments demonstrated that counterfactual simulation played a critical role. Participants simulated where the target ball would have gone if the candidate cause had been removed from the scene. The more certain participants were that the outcome would have been different, the stronger the causal judgments.

	abstract = {Human, horizontal, smooth-pursuit eye movements were recorded by the search coil method in response to Rashbass step-ramp stimuli of 5 to 30deg/s. Eye velocity records were analyzed by measuring features such as the time, velocity and acceleration of the point of peak acceleration, the time and velocity of the peaks and troughs of ringing and steady-state velocity. These values were averaged and mean responses reconstructed. Three normal subjects were studied and their responses averaged. All showed a peak acceleration-velocity saturation. All had ring-ing frequencies near 3.8 Hz and the mean steady-state gain was 0.95. It is argued that a single, linear forward path with any transfer function G(s) and a 100 ms delay (latency) cannot simultaneously simulate the initial rise of acceleration and ring at 3.8 Hz based on a Bode analysis. Also such a simple negative feedback model cannot have a steady-state gain greater than 1.0; a situation that occurs frequently experimentally. L.R. Young's model, which employs internal positive feed-back to eliminate the built-in unity negative feedback, was felt necessary to resolve this problem and a modification of that model is proposed which simu-lates the data base. Acceleration saturation is achieved by borrowing the idea of the local feedback model for saccades so that one nonlinearity can account for the acceleration-velocity saturation: the main sequence for pursuit. Motor plasticity or motor learning, recently demonstrated for pursuit, is atso incorporated and simulated. It was noticed that the offset of pursuit did not show the ringing seen in the onset so this was quantified in one subject. Offset velocity could be characterized by a single exponential with a time constant of about 90 ms. This observation suggests},

	abstract = {Computational learning models are critical for understanding mechanisms of adaptive behavior. However, the two major current frameworks, reinforcement learning ({RL}) and Bayesian learning, both have certain limitations. For example, many Bayesian models are agnostic of inter-individual variability and involve complicated integrals, making online learning difficult. Here, we introduce a generic hierarchical Bayesian framework for individual learning under multiple forms of uncertainty (e.g., environmental volatility and perceptual uncertainty). The model assumes Gaussian random walks of states at all but the first level, with the step size determined by the next highest level. The coupling between levels is controlled by parameters that shape the influence of uncertainty on learning in a subject-specific fashion. Using variational Bayes under a mean-field approximation and a novel approximation to the posterior energy function, we derive trial-by-trial update equations which (i) are analytical and extremely efficient, enabling real-time learning, (ii) have a natural interpretation in terms of {RL}, and (iii) contain parameters representing processes which play a key role in current theories of learning, e.g., precision-weighting of prediction error. These parameters allow for the expression of individual differences in learning and may relate to specific neuromodulatory mechanisms in the brain. Our model is very general: it can deal with both discrete and continuous states and equally accounts for deterministic and probabilistic relations between environmental events and perceptual states (i.e., situations with and without perceptual uncertainty). These properties are illustrated by simulations and analyses of empirical time series. Overall, our framework provides a novel foundation for understanding normal and pathological learning that contextualizes {RL} within a generic Bayesian scheme and thus connects it to principles of optimality from probability theory.},

The 45,000-neuron model was subjected to a battery of visual stimuli, and results were compared to published work and new in vivo experiments. Simulations reproduced a variety of observations, including effects of optogenetic perturbations. Critical to the agreement between responses in silico and in vivo were the rules of functional synaptic connectivity between neurons. Interestingly, after extreme simplification the model still performed satisfactorily on many measurements, although quantitative agreement with experiments suffered. These results emphasize the importance of functional rules of cortical wiring and enable a next generation of data-driven models of in vivo neural activity and computations.},

	abstract = {Animals depend on learned rules to guide their actions. Prefrontal ({PFC}) and premotor ({PMC}) cortex of primates have been reported to display rule-related neural activity, but it is unclear how signals encoded here are utilized to enforce the decision to act. The supplementary eye field ({SEF}) is a candidate for enforcing rule-guided ocular decisions because the activity of neurons here is correlated with the rule in an ocular decision-making task and because this area is anatomically more proximal to movement structures than {PFC} and {PMC} and receives inputs from them. However, in the previous work, the rule encoding and ocular outcome were confounded, leaving open the question of whether {SEF} activity is related to the rule or the behavior. In the present study, we attempted to discriminate between these alternatives by increasing task difficulty and forcing errors, thereby putting the stimulus and the behavior at odds. Single {SEF} neurons were recorded while monkeys performed the task in which the rule is to pursue a moving target if it intersects a visible square and maintain fixation if it does not. A delay period was imposed to monitor neural activity while the target approached the square. Two complementary populations of go and nogo neurons were found. When task difficultly was increased, the monkeys made more errors, and the neurons took longer to encode the rule. However, in error trials, most neurons continued to reflect the rule rather the monkey's ocular decision in both the delay period and after square intersection (movement period). This was the case for both directionally tuned and nondirectional {SEF} neurons. The results suggest that {SEF} neurons encode the ocular decision rule but that the decision itself likely occurs in a different structure that sums rule information from the {SEF} with information from other areas.},

We present in this paper our attempt at outlining the dynamical, parallel and event-based representation for vision in the architecture of the central nervous system. We will illustrate this on static natural images by showing that in a signal matching framework, a L/{LN} (linear/non-linear) cascade may efficiently transform a sensory signal into a neural spiking signal and we will apply this framework to a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete basis as is necessary for modeling the primary visual cortex: we therefore optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral interactions. We compare the efficiency of this representation in terms of compression as the reconstruction quality as a function of the coding length. This will correspond to a modification of the Matching Pursuit algorithm where the {ArgMax} function is optimized for competition, or Competition Optimized Matching Pursuit ({COMP}). We will in particular focus on bridging neuroscience and image processing and on the advantages of such an interdisciplinary approach.},

This model enforces the sparsity of the expansion of local texture patches on adapted atomic elements. The analysis of a given texture within this framework performs the sparse coding of all the patches of the texture into the dictionary of atoms. Conversely, the synthesis of a new texture is performed by solving an optimization problem that seeks for a texture whose patches are sparse in the dictionary. This paper explores several strategies to choose this dictionary. A set of hand crafted dictionaries composed of edges, oscillations, lines or crossings elements allows to synthesize synthetic images with geometric features. Another option is to define the dictionary as the set of all the patches of an input exemplar. This leads to computer graphics methods for synthesis and shares some similarities with non-local means filtering. The last method we explore learns the dictionary by an optimization process that maximizes the sparsity of a set of exemplar patches. Applications of all these methods to texture synthesis, inpainting and classification shows the efficiency of the proposed texture model.},

However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches–decoding and information theory–can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.},

Our motivation was to test a prediction from representational theories of perception (i.e. predictive coding) that primary visual responses should be suppressed by top-down influences during coherent motion. We used a sparse stimulus array such that each element could not fall within the same classical receptive field of primary visual cortex neurons (i.e. precluding lateral interactions within V1). This enabled us to attribute differences, in striate cortex responses, to extra-classical receptive field effects mediated by backward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions we were able to demonstrate suppression of striate cortex activations to coherent relative to incoherent motion. These results suggest that suppression of primary visual cortex responses to coherent motion reflect extra-classical effects mediated by backward connections. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {The imagination is central to esoteric practices, but so far scholars have shown lit-tle interest in exploring cognitive theories of how the imagination works. The only exception is Tanya Luhrmann's interpretive drift theory and related research on mental imagery cultivation, which has been used to explain the subjective persuasiveness of modern ritual magic. This article draws on recent work in the neuroscience of percep-tion in order to develop a general theory of kataphatic (that is, imagery based) practice that goes beyond the interpretive drift theory. Mental imagery is intimately linked with perception. Drawing on " predictive coding " theory, the article argues that kataphatic practices exploit the probabilistic, expectation-based way that the brain processes sen-sory information and creates models (perceptions) of the world. This view throws light on a wide range of features of kataphatic practices, from their contemplative and cogni-tive aspects, to their social organization and demographic make-up, to their pageantry and material culture. By connecting readily observable features of kataphatic practice to specific neurocognitive mechanisms related to perceptual learning and cognitive processing of mental imagery, the predictive coding paradigm also creates opportuni-ties for combining historical research with experimental approaches in the study of religion. I illustrate how this framework may enrich the study of Western esotericism in particular by applying it to the paradigmatic case of " astral travel " as it has devel-oped from the Golden Dawn tradition of ritual magic, especially in the work of Aleister Crowley.},

	abstract = {The onset of vision occurs when neural circuits in the visual cortex are immature, lacking both the full complement of connections and the response selectivity that defines functional maturity. Direction-selective responses are particularly vulnerable to the effects of early visual deprivation, but it remains unclear how stimulus-driven neural activity guides the emergence of cortical direction selectivity. Here we report observations from a motion training protocol that allowed us to monitor the impact of experience on the development of direction-selective responses in visually naive ferrets. Using intrinsic signal imaging techniques, we found that training with a single axis of motion induced the rapid emergence of direction columns that were confined to cortical regions preferentially activated by the training stimulus. Using two-photon calcium imaging techniques, we found that single neurons in visually naive animals exhibited weak directional biases and lacked the strong local coherence in the spatial organization of direction preference that was evident in mature animals. Training with a moving stimulus, but not with a flashed stimulus, strengthened the direction-selective responses of individual neurons and preferentially reversed the direction biases of neurons that deviated from their neighbours. Both effects contributed to an increase in local coherence. We conclude that early experience with moving visual stimuli drives the rapid emergence of direction-selective responses in the visual cortex.},

	abstract = {We recorded the smooth-pursuit eye movements of monkeys in response to targets that were extinguished (blinked) for 200 ms in mid-trajectory. Eye velocity declined considerably during the target blinks, even when the blinks were completely predictable in time and space. Eye velocity declined whether blinks were presented during steady-state pursuit of a constant-velocity target, during initiation of pursuit before target velocity was reached, or during eye accelerations induced by a change in target velocity. When a physical occluder covered the trajectory of the target during blinks, creating the impression that the target moved behind it, the decline in eye velocity was reduced or abolished. If the target was occluded once the eye had reached target velocity, pursuit was only slightly poorer than normal, uninterrupted pursuit. In contrast, if the target was occluded during the initiation of pursuit, while the eye was accelerating toward target velocity, pursuit during occlusion was very different from normal pursuit. Eye velocity remained relatively stable during target occlusion, showing much less acceleration than normal pursuit and much less of a decline than was produced by a target blink. Anticipatory or predictive eye acceleration was typically observed just prior to the reappearance of the target. Computer simulations show that these results are best understood by assuming that a mechanism of eye-velocity memory remains engaged during target occlusion but is disengaged during target blinks.},

The Bours-Lankheet model for motion detection uses counterevidence that relies on a specific combination of the {ON} and {OFF} channels in the early visual system. Specifically, the model detects pairs of flashes that occur separated in space and time. If the flashes have the same contrast polarity, they are interpreted as evidence in favor of the corresponding motion. But if they have opposite contrasts, they are interpreted as evidence against it. This mechanism provides an explanation for reverse-phi (the perceived reversal of an apparent motion stimulus due to periodic contrast-inversions) that is a conceptual departure from the standard explanations of the effect. Here, we investigate this counterevidence mechanism by measuring directional tuning curves of neurons in the primary visual and middle temporal cortex areas of awake, behaving macaques using constant-contrast and inverting-contrast moving dot stimuli. Our electrophysiological data support the Bours-Lankheet model and suggest that the counterevidence computation occurs at an early stage of neural processing not captured by the standard models.},

	abstract = {Author {SummaryEmotion} plays a crucial role in the adaptation of humans and other animals to changes in their world. Nevertheless, emotion has been neglected in Bayesian models of learning in non-stationary environments. The free-energy principle has recently been proposed as a unified account of learning, perception and action in biological agents. In this paper, we propose a formal definition of emotional valence (i.e., the positive and negative character of emotion) in terms of the rate of change of free-energy or, under some simplifying assumptions, of prediction error over time. This formalization leads to a straightforward and simple meta-learning scheme that accounts for the complex and reciprocal interaction between cognition and emotion. We instantiate this scheme with an emotional agent who is able to dynamically assign emotional valence to every new state of the world that is visited and to experience basic forms of emotion. Crucially, our hypothetical agent uses emotional valence to dynamically adapt to unexpected changes in the world. The proposed scheme is very general in the sense that it is not tied to any particular generative model of sensory inputs.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas},
	abstract = {Problematic Humans are able to accurately track a moving object with a combi-nation of saccades and smooth eye movements. These movements allow us to align and stabilize the object on the fovea, thus en-abling high-resolution visual detection. When predictive informa-tion is available about target motion, anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements ({aSPEM}) are efficiently generated before target appearance, which reduce the typical sensorimotor delay between target motion onset and foveation. It is generally assumed that the role of anticipatory eye movements is to limit the behavioral impairment due to eye-to-target position and velocity mismatch. By manipulating the probability for target motion direction we were able to bias the direction and mean velocity of {aSPEM}, as mea-sured during a fixed duration gap before target ramp-motion onset. This suggests that probabilistic information may be used to inform the internal representation of motion prediction for the initiation of anticipatory movements [1]. However, such estimate may become particularly challenging in a dynamic context, where the probabilistic contingencies vary in time in an unpredictable way. In addition, whether and how the infor-mation processing underlying the buildup of {aSPEM} is linked to an explicit estimate of probabilities is unknown. Material and Method In order to answer these questions, we have set up an experi-ment comprising 3 blocks of 200 trials. For each trial, a tar-get makes either to the left or to the right, this direction being drawn from a Bernoulli process. The probability of this process varied in a piecewise-constant (that is, a step function varying be-tween 0 and 1), similarly to Meyniel et al. [2]. The occurence of these switches is itself drawn from a Bernoulli process of probability p switch = 1/40. We asked subjects to perform two tasks on different days :},

	abstract = {How much about our interactions with—and experience of—our world can be deduced from basic principles? This paper reviews recent attempts to understand the self-organised behaviour of embodied agents, like ourselves, as satisfying basic imperatives for sustained exchanges with the environment. In brief, one simple driving force appears to explain many aspects of perception, action and the perception of action. This driving force is the minimisation of surprise or prediction error, which—in the context of perception—corresponds to Bayes-optimal predictive coding (that suppresses exteroceptive prediction errors) and—in the context of action—reduces to classical motor reflexes (that suppress proprioceptive prediction errors). In what follows, we look at some of the phenomena that emerge from this single principle, such as the perceptual encoding of spatial trajectories that can both generate movement (of self) and recognise the movements (of others). These emergent behaviours rest upon prior beliefs about itinerant (wandering) states of the world—but where do these beliefs come from? In this paper, we focus on the nature of prior beliefs and how they underwrite the active sampling of a spatially extended sensorium. Put simply, to avoid surprising states of the world, it is necessary to minimise uncertainty about those states. When this minimisation is implemented via prior beliefs—about how we sample the world—the resulting behaviour is remarkably reminiscent of searches seen in foraging or visual searches with saccadic eye movements.},

We explore here a neuro-mimetic model of the feed-forward connections in the primary visual area ({VI}) solving this problem in the case where the signal may be idealized by a linear generative model using an over-complete dictionary of primitives. Relying on an efficiency criterion, we derive an algorithm as an approximate solution which provides a distributed probabilistic representation of input features and uses incremental greedy inference processes. This algorithm is similar to Matching Pursuit and mimics the parallel and event-based nature of neural computations. We show a simple implementation using a network of integrate-and-fire neurons using fast lateral interactions which transforms an analog signal into a list of spikes. Though simplistic, numerical simulations show that this Sparse Spike Coding strategy provides an efficient representation of natural images compared to classical computational methods. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.},

	abstract = {Low-level perceptual computations may be understood in terms of efficient codes (Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001, Annual Review of Neuroscience 24 1193-216). Following this argument, we explore models of representation for natural static images as a way to understand the processing of information in the primary visual cortex. This representation is here based on a generative linear model of the synthesis of images using an over-complete multi-resolution dictionary of edges. This transform is implemented using log-Gabor filters and permits an exact reconstruction of any image. However, this linear representation is redundant and since to any image may correspond different representations, we explore more efficient representations of the image. The problem is stated as an ill-posed inverse problem and we compare first different known strategies by computing the efficiency of the solutions given by Matching Pursuit (Perrinet, 2004, {IEEE} Trans. Neural Networks 15 1164-75) and sparse edge coding (Fischer, in press, Trans. Image Processing) with classical representation methods such as {JPEG}. This comparison allows us to provide a synthesized approach using a probabilistic representation which would progressively construct the neural representation by using lateral cooperations. We propose an algorithm which dynamically diffuses information to correlated filters so as to yield a progressively disambiguated representation. This approach takes advantage of the computational properties of spiking neurons such as Integrate-and-Fire neurons and provides an efficient yet simple model for the representation of natural images. This representation is directly linked with the edge content of natural images and we show applications of this method to edge extraction, denoising and compression. We also show that this dynamical approach fits with neuro-physiological observations and may explain the non-linear interactions between neighboring neurons which may be observed in the cortex.},

We review, together with experimental evidence, recent theoretical approaches that investigate the advantages of such tight balance for coding and computation. These studies suggest a possible revision of the dominant view that neurons represent information with firing rates corrupted by Poisson noise. Instead, tight excitatory/inhibitory balance may be a signature of a highly cooperative code, orders of magnitude more precise than a Poisson rate code. Moreover, tight balance may provide a template that allows cortical neurons to construct high-dimensional population codes and learn complex functions of their inputs.},

We then asked subjects to align a briefly flashed dot with the moving target. Results showed that the flash-lag effect increased with physical speed at both high and low luminance, but there was no additional increase due to the perceived increase of speed at low luminance.

	title = {Effect of changing feedback delay on spontaneous oscillations in smooth pursuit eye movements of monkeys.},
	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {1. Our goal was to discriminate between two classes of models for pursuit eye movements. The monkey's pursuit system and both classes of model exhibit oscillations around target velocity during tracking of ramp target motion. However, the mechanisms that determine the frequency of oscillations differ in the two classes of model. In "internal feedback" models, oscillations are controlled by internal feedback loops, and the frequency of oscillation does not depend strongly on the delay in visual feedback. In "image motion" models, oscillations are controlled by visual feedback, and the frequency of oscillation does depend on the delay in visual feedback. 2. We measured the frequency of oscillation during pursuit of ramp target motion as a function of the total delay for visual feedback. For the shortest feedback delays of approximately 70 ms, the frequency of oscillation was between 6 and 7 Hz. Increases in feedback delay caused decreases in the frequency of oscillation. The effect of increasing feedback delay was similar, whether the increases were produced naturally by dimming and decreasing the size of the tracking target or artificially with the computer. We conclude that the oscillations in eye velocity during pursuit of ramp target motion are controlled by visual inputs, as suggested by the image motion class of models. 3. Previous experiments had suggested that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are unable to respond well to frequencies as high as the 6-7 Hz at which eye velocity oscillates in monkeys. We therefore tested the response to target vibration at an amplitude of +/- 8 degrees/s and frequencies as high as 15 Hz. For target vibration at 6 Hz, the gain of pursuit, defined as the amplitude of eye velocity divided by the amplitude of target velocity, was as high as 0.65. We conclude that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are capable of processing image motion at high temporal frequencies. 4. The gain of pursuit was much larger when the target vibrated around a constant speed of 15 degrees/s than when it vibrated around a stationary position. This suggests that the pursuit pathways contain a switch that must be closed to allow the visuomotor pathways for pursuit to operate at their full gain. The switch apparently remains open for target vibration around a stationary position. 5. The responses to target vibration revealed a frequency at which eye velocity lagged target velocity by 180 degrees and at which one monkey showed a local peak in the gain of pursuit.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated learning in the pursuit system, but it is unclear whether these effects are the result of changes in visual or motor processing. The ability to maintain smooth pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target provides a way to assess pursuit properties in the absence of visual inputs. To study the long-term effects of learning on nonvisual signals for pursuit, we used an operant conditioning procedure. By providing a reinforcing auditory stimulus during periods of accurate tracking, we increased the pursuit velocity gain during target blanking from 0.59 in the baseline session to 0.89 after 8 to 10 daily sessions of training. Learning also reduced the occurrence of saccades. The learned effects generalized to untrained target velocities and persisted in the presence of a textured visual background. In a yoked-control group, the reinforcer was independent of the subjects' responses, and the velocity gain remained unchanged (from 0.6 to 0.63, respectively, before and after training). In a control group that received no reinforcer, gain increased slightly after repetition of the task (from 0.63 to 0.71, respectively, before and after training). Using a model of pursuit, we show that these effects of learning can be simulated by modifying the gain of an extra-retinal signal. Our results demonstrate that learned contingencies can increase eye velocity in the absence of visual signals and support the view that pursuit is regulated by extra-retinal signals that can undergo long-term plasticity.},

The visual system appears to{\textbackslash}ntake advantage of this prior information, and human{\textbackslash}ncontour detection and grouping performance is well{\textbackslash}npredicted by such an “association field” (Field et{\textbackslash}nal., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible{\textbackslash}ncandidate substrate for implementing an association{\textbackslash}nfield in mammals is the set of long-range lateral{\textbackslash}nconnections between neurons in the primary visual{\textbackslash}ncortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection{\textbackslash}nof contours matching the association field, and/or{\textbackslash}ninhibit detection of other contours (Choe and{\textbackslash}{nMiikkulainen}, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this{\textbackslash}nrole, the lateral connections would need to be{\textbackslash}norientation specific and aligned along contours, and{\textbackslash}nindeed such an arrangement has been found in tree{\textbackslash}nshrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J{\textbackslash}{nNeurosci} 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet{\textbackslash}nknown whether these patterns develop as a result of{\textbackslash}nvisual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be{\textbackslash}nappropriate for the statistics of natural scenes.{\textbackslash}{nTo} investigate this issue, we examined the{\textbackslash}nproperties of the visual environment of laboratory{\textbackslash}nanimals, to determine whether the observed{\textbackslash}nconnection patterns are more similar to the{\textbackslash}nstatistics of the rearing environment or of a{\textbackslash}nnatural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the{\textbackslash}ncooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of{\textbackslash}nnatural scenes, and compared them to corresponding{\textbackslash}nstatistics for images taken from within the rearing{\textbackslash}nenvironment of the animals in the Bosking et{\textbackslash}nal. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the{\textbackslash}nalgorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a moreŋeneral edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse{\textbackslash}ncoding to avoid multiple responses to a single{\textbackslash}nedge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for{\textbackslash}nnatural images replicated qualitatively the results{\textbackslash}nfrom Geisler et al.

However, we find{\textbackslash}nthat the largely man-made environment in which these{\textbackslash}nanimals were reared has a significantly higher{\textbackslash}nprobability of collinear edge elements. We thus{\textbackslash}npredict that if the lateral connection patterns are{\textbackslash}ndue to visual experience, the patterns in{\textbackslash}nwild-raised tree shrews would be very different from{\textbackslash}nthose measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with{\textbackslash}nshorter-range correlations and less emphasis on{\textbackslash}ncollinear continuations. This prediction can be{\textbackslash}ntested in future experiments on matching groups of{\textbackslash}nanimals reared in different environments.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference provides a cogent account of how the brain combines sensory information with "priors" based on past experience to guide many behaviors, including smooth pursuit eye movements. We now demonstrate very rapid adaptation of the pursuit system's priors for target direction and speed. We go on to leverage that adaptation to outline possible neural mechanisms that could cause pursuit to show features consistent with Bayesian inference. Adaptation of the prior causes changes in the eye speed and direction at the initiation of pursuit. The adaptation appears after a single trial and accumulates over repeated exposure to a given history of target speeds and directions. The influence of the priors depends on the reliability of visual motion signals: priors are more effective against the visual motion signals provided by low-contrast vs. high-contrast targets. Adaptation of the direction prior generalizes to eye speed and vice versa, suggesting that both priors could be controlled by a single neural mechanism. We conclude that the pursuit system can learn the statistics of visual motion rapidly and use those statistics to guide future behavior. Furthermore, a model that adjusts the gain of visual-motor transmission predicts the effects of recent experience on pursuit direction and speed, as well as the specifics of the generalization between the priors for speed and direction. We suggest that Bayesian inference in pursuit behavior is implemented by distinctly non-Bayesian internal mechanisms that use the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields to control of the gain of visual-motor transmission.{NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} Bayesian inference can account for the interaction between sensory data and past experience in many behaviors. Here, we show, using smooth pursuit eye movements, that the priors based on past experience can be adapted over a very short time frame. We also show that a single model based on direction-specific adaptation of the strength of visual-motor transmission can explain the implementation and adaptation of priors for both target direction and target speed.},

	abstract = {In the past, computational motor control has been approached from at least two major frameworks: the dynamic systems approach and the viewpoint of optimal control. The dynamic system approach emphasizes motor control as a process of self-organization between an animal and its environment. Nonlinear differential equations that can model entrainment and synchronization behavior are among the most favorable tools of dynamic systems modelers. In contrast, optimal control approaches view motor control as the evolutionary or development result of a nervous system that tries to optimize rather general organizational principles, e.g., energy consumption or accurate task achievement. Optimal control theory is usually employed to develop appropriate theories. Interestingly, there is rather little interaction between dynamic systems and optimal control modelers as the two approaches follow rather different philosophies and are often viewed as diametrically opposing. In this paper, we develop a computational approach to motor control that offers a unifying modeling framework for both dynamic systems and optimal control approaches. In discussions of several behavioral experiments and some theoretical and robotics studies, we demonstrate how our computational ideas allow both the representation of self-organizing processes and the optimization of movement based on reward criteria. Our modeling framework is rather simple and general, and opens opportunities to revisit many previous modeling results from this novel unifying view. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements allow the approximate stabilization of a moving visual target on the retina. To study the dynamics of smooth pursuit, we measured eye velocity during the visual tracking of a Gabor target moving at a constant velocity plus a noisy perturbation term. The optimal linear filter linking fluctuations in target velocity to evoked fluctuations in eye velocity was computed. These filters predicted eye velocity to novel stimuli in the 0- to 15-Hz band with good accuracy, showing that pursuit maintenance is approximately linear under these conditions. The shape of the filters were indicative of fast dynamics, with pure delays of merely approximately 67 ms, times-to-peak of approximately 115 ms, and effective integration times of approximately 45 ms. The gain of the system, reflected in the amplitude of the filters, was inversely proportional to the size of the velocity fluctuations and independent of the target mean speed. A modest slow-down of the dynamics was observed as the contrast of the target decreased. Finally, the temporal filters recovered during fixation and pursuit were similar in shape, supporting the notion that they might share a common underlying circuitry. These findings show that the visual tracking of moving objects by the human eye includes a reflexive-like pathway with high contrast sensitivity and fast dynamics.},

	abstract = {Background: Many visual areas of the primate brain contain signals related to the current position of the eyes in the orbit. These cortical eye-position signals are thought to underlie the transformation of retinal input - which changes with every eye movement - into a stable representation of visual space. For this coding scheme to work, such signals would need to be updated fast enough to keep up with the eye during normal exploratory behavior. We examined the dynamics of cortical eye-position signals in four dorsal visual areas of the macaque brain: the lateral and ventral intraparietal areas ({LIP}; {VIP}), the middle temporal area ({MT}), and the medial-superior temporal area ({MST}). We recorded extracellular activity of single neurons while the animal performed sequences of fixations and saccades in darkness. Results: The data show that eye-position signals are updated predictively, such that the representation shifts in the direction of a saccade prior to ({\textless}100 ms) the actual eye movement. Despite this early start, eye-position signals remain inaccurate until shortly after (10-150 ms) the eye movement. By using simulated behavioral experiments, we show that this brief misrepresentation of eye position provides a neural explanation for the psychophysical phenomenon of perisaccadic mislocalization, in which observers misperceive the positions of visual targets flashed around the time of saccadic eye movements. Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that eye-position signals in the dorsal visual system are updated rapidly across eye movements and play a direct role in perceptual localization, even when they are erroneous. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

We consider here a ring model of spiking neurons, intended as a simplified computational model of a single hypercolumn of the primary visual cortex. Signals that consist of edges with time-varying orientations localized in space are considered. Our model is calibrated to produce spontaneous and driven firing rates roughly consistent with experiments, and our two main findings, for which we offer dynamical explanation on the level of neuronal interactions, are the following: (1) We have documented consistent transient overshoots in signal perception following signal switches due to emergent interactions of the E- and I-populations, and (2) for continuously moving signals, we have found that accuracy is considerably lower at reversals of orientation than when continuing in the same direction (as when the signal is a rotating bar). To measure performance, we use two metrics, called fidelity and reliability, to compare signals reconstructed by the system to the ones presented, and to assess trial-to-trial variability. We propose that the same population mechanisms responsible for orientation selectivity also impose constraints on dynamic signal tracking that manifest in perception failures consistent with psychophysical observations.},

	abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and {fMRI} responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise {fMRI} experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic. © 2003 Elsevier Science ({USA}).

	abstract = {Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks ({NNs}) as approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout {NNs} – extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using {MNIST} as an example. We show a considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and {RMSE} compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty in deep reinforcement learning.},

However, in certain circumstances, the activity of the dopamine cells seems anomalous under the model, as they respond in particular ways to stimuli that are not obviously related to predictions of reward. In this paper, we address two important sets of anomalies, those having to do with generalization and novelty. Generalization responses are treated as the natural consequence of partial information; novelty responses are treated by the suggestion that dopamine cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including exploration bonuses and shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for dopamine in terms of the mechanistic attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration. Copyright © 2002 .},

This approach is amenable to a sparse signal representation and enables the extraction of relevant features from thousands of sensing elements with sub-millisecond temporal precision. We also proposed measures adopted from computational neuroscience to study the information content as spiking representations of artificial tactile signals. Implemented on a state-of-the-art 4096 element tactile sensor array with 5.2 {kHz} sampling frequency, we demonstrate the classification of transient impact events while utilizing 20 times less communication bandwidth compared to frame based representations. Spiking sensor responses to 300 different contact conditions were also synthesized using finite element simulations, illustrating an 8-fold improvement in information content and a 4-fold reduction in classification latency when millisecond-precise temporal structures are available. Hence, a neuromorphic spatiotemporal representation of touch is well suited to rapid identification of critical contact events, making it suitable for dynamic tactile sensing in robotic and prosthetic applications.},

This ability is important for many activities such as ball sports, and a close relation has been shown between {DVA} and sports expertise. {DVA} tasks involve eye movements, yet, it is unclear which aspects of eye movements contribute to successful performance. Here we examined the relation between {DVA} and the kinematics of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements in a cohort of 23 varsity baseball players. In a computerized dynamic-object {DVA} test, observers reported the location of the gap in a small Landolt-C ring moving at various speeds while eye movements were recorded. Smooth pursuit kinematics-eye latency, acceleration, velocity gain, position error-and the direction and amplitude of saccadic eye movements were linked to perceptual performance. Results reveal that distinct eye movement patterns-minimizing eye position error, tracking smoothly, and inhibiting reverse saccades-were related to dynamic visual acuity. The close link between eye movement quality and {DVA} performance has important implications for the development of perceptual training programs to improve {DVA}.},

	abstract = {We use visual image motion to judge the movement of objects, as well as our own movements through the environment. Generally, image motion components caused by object motion and self-motion are confounded in the retinal image. Thus, to estimate heading, the brain would ideally marginalize out the effects of object motion (or vice-versa), but little is known about how this is accomplished neurally. Behavioral studies suggest that vestibular signals play a role in dissociating object motion and self-motion, and recent computational work suggests that a linear decoder can approximate marginalization by taking advantage of diverse multisensory representations. By measuring responses of {MSTd} neurons in two male rhesus monkeys and by applying a recently-developed method to approximate marginalization by linear population decoding, we tested the hypothesis that vestibular signals help to dissociate self-motion and object motion. We show that vestibular signals stabilize tuning for heading in neurons with congruent visual and vestibular heading preferences, whereas they stabilize tuning for object motion in neurons with discrepant preferences. Thus, vestibular signals enhance the separability of joint tuning for object motion and self-motion. We further show that a linear decoder, designed to approximate marginalization, allows the population to represent either self-motion or object motion with good accuracy. Decoder weights are broadly consistent with a readout strategy, suggested by recent computational work, in which responses are decoded according to the vestibular preferences of multisensory neurons. These results demonstrate, at both single neuron and population levels, that vestibular signals help to dissociate self-motion and object motion.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENTThe} brain often needs to estimate one property of a changing environment while ignoring others. This can be difficult since multiple properties of the environment may be confounded in sensory signals. The brain can solve this problem by marginalizing over irrelevant properties to estimate the property of interest. We explore this problem in the context of self-motion and object motion, which are inherently confounded in the retinal image. We examine how diversity in a population of multisensory neurons may be exploited to decode self-motion and object motion from the population activity of neurons in macaque area {MSTd}.},

Humans integrate motion over large areas and can perceive what has been referred to as global motion. The large size and direction selectivity of {MT} receptive fields suggests that {MT} neurons may represent global motion. We have explored this possibility by measuring responses to a stimulus in which the directions of simultaneously presented local and global motion are independently controlled. Surprisingly, {MT} responses depended only on the local motion and were unaffected by the global motion. Yet, under similar conditions, human observers perceive global motion and are impaired in discriminating local motion. Although local motion perception might depend on {MT} signals, global motion perception depends on mechanisms qualitatively different from those in {MT}. Motion perception therefore does not depend on a single cortical area but reflects the action and interaction of multiple brain systems.},

Here we studied the quality of pursuit movements to curved motion trajectories in human observers and examined whether the pursuit responses would be sensitive enough to discriminate various degrees of curvature. In a two interval forced choice task subjects pursued a Gaussian blob moving along a curved trajectory and then they indicated in which interval the curve was flatter. We also measured discrimination thresholds for the same curvatures during a fixation. Motion curvature had some specific effects on smooth pursuit properties: trajectories with larger amounts of curvature elicited lower open-loop acceleration, lower pursuit gain and larger catch-up saccades compared to less curved trajectories. Initially, target motion curvatures were underestimated, however, around 300 ms after pursuit onset, pursuit responses closely matched the actual curved trajectory. We calculated perceptual thresholds for curvature discrimination, which were on the order of 1.5 degrees of visual angle (deg) for a 7.9 deg curvature standard. Oculometric sensitivity to curvature discrimination based on the whole pursuit trajectory was quite similar to perceptual performance. Oculometric thresholds based on smaller time windows were higher. Thus, smooth pursuit can quite accurately follow moving targets with curved trajectories, but temporal integration over longer periods is necessary to reach perceptual thresholds for curvature discrimination.},

A high detection rate is possible even though the spatial and temporal characteristics (step size and frame rate) of the signal are identical to the noise, making the signal indistinguishable from the noise on the basis of a single pair of frames. The success rate for detecting the signal dot was as high as 90\% when the probability of mismatch from frame-to-frame, based on nearest-neighbor matching, was 0.3. Control experiments showed that trajectory detection is not based on detecting a "string" of collinear dots, i.e. a stationary position cue. Nor is a trajectory detected because it produces stronger signals in single independent motion detectors. For one thing, trajectory detection improves with increases in duration, up to 250-400 msec, a duration longer than the integration typically associated with a single motion detector. For another, the signal dot need not travel in a straight line to be detectable. The signal dot was as reliably detected when it changed its direction a small amount (about 30 deg or less) each frame. Consistent with this, circular paths of sufficiently low curvature were as detectable as straight trajectories. Our data suggest that trajectory motion is highly detectable in motion noise because the component local motion signals are enhanced when motion detectors with similar directional tuning are stimulated in a sequence along their preferred direction.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in Deep convolutional Neural Networks ({DNNs}) have enabled unprecedentedly accurate computational models of brain representations, and present an exciting opportunity to model diverse cognitive functions. State-of-the-art {DNNs} achieve human-level performance on object categorisation, but it is unclear how well they capture human behavior on complex cognitive tasks. Recent reports suggest that {DNNs} can explain significant variance in one such task, judging object similarity. Here, we extend these findings by replicating them for a rich set of object images, comparing performance across layers within two {DNNs} of different depths, and examining how the {DNNs}' performance compares to that of non-computational "conceptual" models. Human observers performed similarity judgments for a set of 92 images of real-world objects. Representations of the same images were obtained in each of the layers of two {DNNs} of different depths (8-layer {AlexNet} and 16-layer {VGG}-16). To create conceptual models, other human observers generated visual-feature labels (e.g., "eye") and category labels (e.g., "animal") for the same image set. Feature labels were divided into parts, colors, textures and contours, while category labels were divided into subordinate, basic, and superordinate categories. We fitted models derived from the features, categories, and from each layer of each {DNN} to the similarity judgments, using representational similarity analysis to evaluate model performance. In both {DNNs}, similarity within the last layer explains most of the explainable variance in human similarity judgments. The last layer outperforms almost all feature-based models. Late and mid-level layers outperform some but not all feature-based models. Importantly, categorical models predict similarity judgments significantly better than any {DNN} layer. Our results provide further evidence for commonalities between {DNNs} and brain representations. Models derived from visual features other than object parts perform relatively poorly, perhaps because {DNNs} more comprehensively capture the colors, textures and contours which matter to human object perception. However, categorical models outperform {DNNs}, suggesting that further work may be needed to bring high-level semantic representations in {DNNs} closer to those extracted by humans. Modern {DNNs} explain similarity judgments remarkably well considering they were not trained on this task, and are promising models for many aspects of human cognition.},

In this perspective, eye movements collect evidence related to target detection and verification to guide the decision. We investigated whether, in real-world scenes, target detection and verification are differentially recruited in the decision-making process in the presence of prior information (expectations about target location) and perceptual uncertainty (noise). We used a mouse-tracking methodology with which mouse trajectories unveil components of decision-making and eye-tracking measures reflect target detection and verification. Indoor scenes were presented, including a target in usual or unusual locations or no target, and were degraded with additive noise (or no noise). Participants had to respond to the target's presence or absence. Degrading the scene delayed the decision due to increased verification times and reduced mouse velocity. Targets in unusual locations delayed the decision and deviated mouse trajectories toward the target-absent response. Detection times played a major role in these effects. Thus, target detection and verification processes influence decision-making by integrating the available sources of information differently and lead to an accumulation of evidence toward both the presence of a target and its absence.},

In this illusion, flashed and moving objects appear spatially offset when their retinal images are physically aligned. The steady-state phase of the ramp-response was probed using the "continuous-motion" ({CM}) paradigm, in which the motion of the moving object starts long before the occurrence of the flash. To probe the transient phase of the ramp-response, we used the "flash-initiated cycle" ({FIC}) paradigm, in which the motion of the moving object starts within a short time window around the presentation of the flash. The sampling instant of the ramp-response was varied systematically by changing the luminance or the presentation time of the flashed stimulus. We found that the perceived flash misalignments in the {FIC} and {CM} paradigms were approximately equal when sampling of the ramp-response occurred after a relatively long delay from the onset of motion and, were significantly different when sampling of the ramp-response occurred at a relatively short delay. The systematic variations in the perceived misalignment between the moving and flashed stimuli as a function of stimulus parameters are compared to the predictions of our differential latency and to alternative models of position computation.},

Biophysical mechanisms underlying this sparsification phenomenon remain poorly understood. Here, we present a dynamic systems modeling study of a developing neural network that provides the first mechanistic insights into sparsification. We find that the rest state of immature networks is strongly affected by the dynamics of a transient, unstable state hidden in their firing activities, allowing these networks to either be silent or generate large cluster activity. We address how, and which, specific developmental changes in neuronal and synaptic parameters drive sparsification. We also reveal how these changes refine the information processing capabilities of an in vivo developing network, mainly by showing a developmental reduction in the instability of network's firing activity, an effective availability of inhibition-stabilized states, and an emergence of spontaneous attractors and state transition mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the key role of {GABAergic} transmission and depressing glutamatergic synapses in governing the spatiotemporal evolution of cluster activity. These results, by providing a strong link between experimental observations and model behavior, suggest how adult sparse coding networks may emerge developmentally.},

	abstract = {How do we navigate a deeply structured world? Why are you reading this sentence first – and did you actually look at the fifth word? This review offers some answers by appealing to active inference based on deep temporal models. It builds on previous formulations of active inference to simulate behavioural and electrophysiological responses under hierarchical generative models of state transitions. Inverting these models corresponds to sequential inference, such that the state at any hierarchical level entails a sequence of transitions in the level below. The deep temporal aspect of these models means that evidence is accumulated over nested time scales, enabling inferences about narratives (i.e., temporal scenes). We illustrate this behaviour with Bayesian belief updating – and neuronal process theories – to simulate the epistemic foraging seen in reading. These simulations reproduce perisaccadic delay period activity and local field potentials seen empirically. Finally, we exploit the deep structure of these models to simulate responses to local (e.g., font type) and global (e.g., semantic) violations; reproducing mismatch negativity and P300 responses respectively.},

For flexibility, Edward makes it easy to fit the same model using a variety of composable inference methods, ranging from point estimation to variational inference to {MCMC}. In addition, Edward can reuse the modeling representation as part of inference, facilitating the design of rich variational models and generative adversarial networks. For efficiency, Edward is integrated into {TensorFlow}, providing significant speedups over existing probabilistic systems. For example, we show on a benchmark logistic regression task that Edward is at least 35x faster than Stan and 6x faster than {PyMC}3. Further, Edward incurs no runtime overhead: it is as fast as handwritten {TensorFlow}.},

As a corollary to this analysis, we derive for the first time upper bounds on the {VC} dimension of Convolutional Neural Network as well as Dropout and Dropconnect networks and the relation between excess error rate of Dropout and Dropconnect networks. The concept of intrinsic dimension is used to validate the intuition that texture-based datasets are inherently higher dimensional as compared to handwritten digits or other object recognition datasets and hence more difficult to be shattered by neural networks.

We derived a simple parametric decoder assuming neuronal independence and a more sophisticated empirical decoder that learned the structure of the measured neuronal response distributions, including their correlated variability. The empirical decoder used the structure of these response distributions to perform better than its parametric variant, indicating that their structure contains critical information for sensory decoding.

Current neuroimaging research suggests that presaccadic stimulation has a late effect on postsaccadic processing, in contrast to the early effect seen in behavioral studies. Human participants (both male and female) were instructed to saccade toward a face or a house that, on different trials, remained the same, changed, or disappeared during the saccade. We used a multivariate pattern analysis of electroencephalography data to decode face versus house processing directly after the saccade. The classifier was trained on separate trials without a saccade, where a house or face was presented at the fovea. When the saccade target remained the same across the saccade, we could reliably decode the target 123 ms after saccade offset. In contrast, when the target was changed during the saccade, the new target was decoded at a later time-point, 151 ms after saccade offset. The "same" condition advantage suggests that congruent presaccadic information facilitates processing of the postsaccadic stimulus compared with incongruent information. Finally, the saccade target could be decoded above chance even when it had been removed during the saccade, albeit with a slower time course (162 ms) and poorer signal strength. These findings indicate that information about the (peripheral) presaccadic stimulus is transferred across the saccade so that it becomes quickly available and influences processing at its expected new retinal position (the fovea).{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Here we provide neural evidence for early information transfer across saccades. Specifically, we examined the effect of presaccadic sensory information on the initial neuronal processing of a postsaccadic stimuli. Using electroencephalography and multivariate pattern analysis, we found the following: (1) that the identity of the presaccadic stimulus modulated the postsaccadic latency of stimulus relevant information; and (2) that a saccadic neural marker for a saccade target stimulus could be detected even when the stimulus had been removed during saccade. These results demonstrate that information about the peripheral presaccadic stimulus was transferred across the saccade and influenced processing at a new retinal position (the fovea) directly after the saccade landed.},

	title = {Decoding center-surround interactions in population of neurons for the ocular following response},
	rights = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Short presentation of a large moving pattern elicits an Ocular Following Response ({OFR}) that exhibits many of the properties attributed to low-level motion processing such as spatial and temporal integration, contrast gain control and divisive interaction between competing motions. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys. More recent experiments of {OFR} have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the global spatial integration of motion from an intermediate map of possible local translation velocities: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving {OFR}, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barthelemy06,Barthelemy07]. In fact, the machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensorimotor transformation is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss02] and we extended in the dynamical domain the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We proved that this model is successfully adapted to model the {OFR} for the different experiments [Perrinet07neurocomp], that is for different levels of noise with full field gratings, with disks of various sizes and also for the effect of a flickering surround. However, another {\textbackslash}emphad hoc inhibitory mechanism has to be added in this model to account for suppressive effects of the surround. We explore here an hypothesis where this could be understood as the effect of a recurrent prediction of information in the velocity map. In fact, in previous models, the integration step assumes independence of the local information while natural scenes are very predictable: Due to the rigidity and inertia of physical objects in visual space, neighboring local spatiotemporal information is redundant and one may introduce this {\textbackslash}empha priori knowledge of the statistics of the input in the ideal observer model. We implement this in a realistic model of a layer representing velocities in a map of cortical columns, where predictions are implemented by lateral interactions within the cortical area. First, raw velocities are estimated locally from images and are propagated to this area in a feed-forward manner. Using this velocity map, we progressively learn the dependance of local velocities in a second layer of the model. This algorithm is cyclic since the prediction is using the local velocities which are themselves using both the feed-forward input and the prediction: We control the convergence of this process by measuring results for different learning rate. Results show that this simple model is sufficient to disambiguate characteristic patterns such as the Barber-Pole illusion. Due to the recursive network which is modulating the velocity map, it also explains that the representation may exhibit some memory, such as when an object suddenly disappears or when presenting a dot followed by a line (line-motion illusion). Finally, we applied this model that was tuned over a set of natural scenes to gratings of increasing sizes. We observed first that the feed-forward response as tuned to neurophysiological data gave lower responses at higher eccentricities, and that this effect was greater for higher grating frequencies. Then, we observed that depending on the size of the disk and on its spatial frequency, the recurrent network of lateral interactions Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.},

	abstract = {Primates use a combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements to stabilize the retinal image of selected objects within the high-acuity region near the fovea. Pursuit has traditionally been viewed as a relatively automatic behavior, driven by visual motion signals and mediated by pathways that connect visual areas in the cerebral cortex to motor regions in the cerebellum. However, recent findings indicate that this view needs to be reconsidered. Rather than being controlled primarily by areas in extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an extended network of cortical areas, and, of these, the pursuit-related region in the frontal eye fields appears to exert the most direct influence. The traditional pathways through the cerebellum are important, but there are also newly identified routes involving structures previously associated with the control of saccades, including the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus, and nuclei in the brain stem reticular formation. These recent findings suggest that the pursuit system has a functional architecture very similar to that of the saccadic system. This viewpoint provides a new perspective on the processing steps that occur as descending control signals interact with circuits in the brain stem and cerebellum responsible for gating and executing voluntary eye movements. Although the traditional view describes pursuit and saccades as two distinct neural systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as different outcomes from a shared cascade of sensory-motor functions.},

	abstract = {Sentence processing takes place in real-time. Previous words in the sentence can influence the processing of the current word in the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds. Recent neurophysiological studies in humans suggest that the fronto-striatal system (frontal cortex, and striatum–the major input locus of the basal ganglia) plays a crucial role in this process. The current research provides a possible explanation of how certain aspects of this real-time processing can occur, based on the dynamics of recurrent cortical networks, and plasticity in the cortico-striatal system. We simulate prefrontal area {BA}47 as a recurrent network that receives on-line input about word categories during sentence processing, with plastic connections between cortex and striatum. We exploit the homology between the cortico-striatal system and reservoir computing, where recurrent frontal cortical networks are the reservoir, and plastic cortico-striatal synapses are the readout. The system is trained on sentence-meaning pairs, where meaning is coded as activation in the striatum corresponding to the roles that different nouns and verbs play in the sentences. The model learns an extended set of grammatical constructions, and demonstrates the ability to generalize to novel constructions. It demonstrates how early in the sentence, a parallel set of predictions are made concerning the meaning, which are then confirmed or updated as the processing of the input sentence proceeds. It demonstrates how on-line responses to words are influenced by previous words in the sentence, and by previous sentences in the discourse, providing new insight into the neurophysiology of the P600 {ERP} scalp response to grammatical complexity. This demonstrates that a recurrent neural network can decode grammatical structure from sentences in real-time in order to generate a predictive representation of the meaning of the sentences. This can provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of human cortico-striatal function in sentence processing.},

Extracting information from these population codes is difficult because of the noise inherent in neuronal responses.

Using simulations and analysis, we show that a close approximation to {ML} can be implemented in a biologically plausible model of cortical circuitry. Our results apply to a wide range of nonlinear activation functions, suggesting that cortical areas may, in general, function as ideal observers of activity in preceding areas.},

But evidence has slowly accumulated that computations that take into account probabilistic relationships among visual forms and the target contribute to optimizing decisions in biological and artificial organisms, even without considering these limited-capacity processes in covert attention or even foveation. The benefits from such computations can be formalized within the framework of an ideal Bayesian observer and can be related to the classic theory of sensory cue combination in vision science and context-driven approaches to object detection in computer vision. The framework can account for a large range of behavioral findings across distinct experimental paradigms, including visual search, cueing, and scene context.

It has been proposed that expectations lead to prestimulus baseline increases in sensory neurons tuned to the expected stimulus, which in turn, affect the processing of subsequent stimuli. Recent {fMRI} studies have revealed stimulus-specific patterns of activation in sensory cortex as a result of expectation, but this method lacks the temporal resolution necessary to distinguish pre- from poststimulus processes. Here, we combined human magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) with multivariate decoding techniques to probe the representational content of neural signals in a time-resolved manner. We observed a representation of expected stimuli in the neural signal shortly before they were presented, showing that expectations indeed induce a preactivation of stimulus templates. The strength of these prestimulus expectation templates correlated with participants' behavioral improvement when the expected feature was task-relevant. These results suggest a mechanism for how predictive perception can be neurally implemented.},

	abstract = {In the natural world, the brain must handle inherent delays in visual processing. This is a problem particularly during dynamic tasks. A possible solution to visuo-motor delays is prediction of a future state of the environment based on the current state and properties of the environment learned from experience. Prediction is well known to occur in both saccades and pursuit movements and is likely to depend on some kind of internal visual model as the basis for this prediction. However, most evidence comes from controlled laboratory studies using simple paradigms. In this study, we examine eye movements made in the context of demanding natural behavior, while playing squash. We show that prediction is a pervasive component of gaze behavior in this context. We show in addition that these predictive movements are extraordinarily precise and operate continuously in time across multiple trajectories and multiple movements. This suggests that prediction is based on complex dynamic visual models of the way that balls move, accumulated over extensive experience. Since eye, head, arm, and body movements all co-occur, it seems likely that a common internal model of predicted visual state is shared by different effectors to allow flexible coordination patterns. It is generally agreed that internal models are responsible for predicting future sensory state for control of body movements. The present work suggests that model-based prediction is likely to be a pervasive component in natural gaze control as well.},

We assume that the brain models the world as a hierarchy or cascade of dynamical systems that encode causal structure in the sensorium. Perception is equated with the optimization or inversion of these internal models, to explain sensory data. Given a model of how sensory data are generated, we can invoke a generic approach to model inversion, based on a free energy bound on the model's evidence. The ensuing free-energy formulation furnishes equations that prescribe the process of recognition, i.e. the dynamics of neuronal activity that represent the causes of sensory input. Here, we focus on a very general model, whose hierarchical and dynamical structure enables simulated brains to recognize and predict trajectories or sequences of sensory states. We first review hierarchical dynamical models and their inversion. We then show that the brain has the necessary infrastructure to implement this inversion and illustrate this point using synthetic birds that can recognize and categorize birdsongs.},

	abstract = {Eye movements were recorded in human subjects who tracked a target spot which moved horizontally at constant speeds. At random times during its trajectory, the target disappeared for variable periods of time and the subjects attempted to continue tracking the invisible target. The smooth pursuit component of their eye movements was isolated and averaged. About 190 ms after the target disappeared, the smooth pursuit velocity began to decelerate rapidly. The time course of this deceleration was similar to that in response to a visible target whose velocity decreased suddenly. After a deceleration lasting about 280 ms, the velocity stabilized at a new, reduced level which we call the residual velocity. The residual velocity remained more or less constant or declined only slowly even when the target remained invisible for 4 s. When the same target velocity was used in all trials of an experiment, the subjects' residual velocity amounted to 60\% of their normal pursuit velocity. When the velocity was varied randomly from trial to trial, the residual velocity was smaller; for target velocities of 5, 10, and 20 deg/s it reached 55, 47, and 39\% respectively. The subjects needed to see targets of unforeseeable velocity for no more than 300 ms in order to develop a residual velocity that was characteristic of the given target velocity. When a target of unknown velocity disappeared at the very moment the subject expected it to start, a smooth movement developed nonetheless and reached within 300 ms a peak velocity of 5 deg/s which was independent of the actual target velocity and reflected a "default" value for the pursuit system. Thereafter the eyes decelerated briefly and then continued with a constant or slightly decreasing velocity of 2-4 deg/s until the target reappeared. Even when the subjects saw no moving target during an experiment, they could produce a smooth movement in the dark and could grade its velocity as a function of that of an imagined target. We suggest that the residual velocity reflects a first order prediction of target movement which is attenuated by a variable gain element. When subjects are pursuing a visible target, the gain of this element is close to unity. When the target disappears but continued tracking is attempted, the gain is reduced to a value between 0.4 and 0.6.},

We posit that any self-organizing system must embody a generative model whose predictions ensure that (expected) free energy is minimized through action. Plants respond in a fast, and yet coordinated manner, to environmental contin-gencies. They pro-actively sample their local environment to elicit information with an adaptive value. Our main thesis is that plant behaviour takes place by way of a process (active inference) that predicts the environmental sources of sensory stimulation. This principle, we argue, endows plants with a form of perception that underwrites purposeful, anticipatory behaviour. The aim of the article is to assess the prospects of a radical predictive processing story that would follow naturally from the free-energy principle for biological systems; an approach that may ultimately bear upon our understanding of life and cognition more broadly.},

To understand how this relationship is maintained, we broadly suppressed the activity of parvalbumin-expressing ({PV}+) inhibitory neurons and asked how this affected the balance of excitation and inhibition throughout auditory cortex. Activating archaerhodopsin in {PV}+neurons effectively suppressed them in layer 4. However, the resulting increase in excitation outweighed Arch suppression and produced a net increase in {PV}+ activity in downstream layers. Consequently, suppressing {PV}+neurons did not reduce inhibition to principal neurons ({PNs}) but instead resulted in a tightly coordinated increase in both excitation and inhibition. The increase in inhibition constrained the magnitude of {PN} spiking responses to the increase in excitation and produced nonlinear changes in spike tuning. Excitatory-inhibitory rebalancing is mediated by strong {PN}-{PV}+connectivity within and between layers and is likely engaged during normal cortical operation to ensure balance in downstream neurons.},

	abstract = {The response of motion-selective neurons in primary visual cortex is ambiguous with respect to the two-dimensional (2D) velocity of spatially extensive objects. To investigate how local neural activity is integrated in the computation of global motion, we asked observers to judge the direction of a rigidly translating natural scene viewed through 16 apertures. We report a novel relative oblique effect: local contour orientations parallel or orthogonal to the direction of motion yield more precise and less biased estimates of direction than other orientations. This effect varies inversely with the local orientation variance of the natural scenes. Analysis of contour orientations across aperture pairings extends previous research on plaids and indicates that observers are biased toward the faster moving contour for Type I pairings. Finally, we show that observers' bias and precision as a function of the orientation statistics of natural scenes can be accounted for by an interaction between naturally arising anisotropies in natural scenes and a template model of {MT} that is optimally tuned for isotropic stimuli.},

Python leverages a vast developer-base external to the neuroscience community, and promises leaps in simulation complexity and maintainability to any neural simulator that adopts it. {PyNN} http://neuralensemble.org/{PyNN} strives to provide a uniform application programming interface ({API}) across neural simulators. Presently {NEURON} and {NEST} are supported, and support for other simulators and neuromorphic {VLSI} hardware is under development. With {PyNN} it is possible to write a simulation script once and run it without modification on any supported simulator. It is also possible to write a script that uses capabilities specific to a single simulator. While this sacrifices simulator-independence, it adds flexibility, and can be a useful step in porting models between simulators. The design goals of {PyNN} include allowing access to low-level details of a simulation where necessary, while providing the capability to model at a high level of abstraction, with concomitant gains in development speed and simulation maintainability. Another of our aims with {PyNN} is to increase the productivity of neuroscience modeling, by making it faster to develop models de novo, by promoting code sharing and reuse across simulator communities, and by making it much easier to debug, test and validate simulations by running them on more than one simulator. Modelers would then become free to devote more software development effort to innovation, building on the simulator core with new tools such as network topology databases, stimulus programming, analysis and visualization tools, and simulation accounting. The resulting, community-developed 'meta-simulator' system would then represent a powerful tool for overcoming the so-called complexity bottleneck that is presently a major roadblock for neural modeling.},

	abstract = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. {PyNN} is such an interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently {NEURON}, {NEST}, {PCSIM}, Brian and the Heidelberg {VLSI} neuromorphic hardware). {PyNN} increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization and data-management tools. {PyNN} increases the reliability of modelling studies by making it much easier to check results on multiple simulators. {PyNN} is open-source software and is available from http://neuralensemble.org/{PyNN}.},

	abstract = {Accuracy in estimating an object's global motion over time is not only affected by the noise in visual motion information but also by the spatial limitation of the local motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that during the initial stages of the motion information processing, 1D motion cues related to the object's edges have a dominating influence over the estimate of the object's global motion. However, during the later stages, 2D motion cues related to terminators (edge-endings) progressively take over, leading to a final correct estimate of the object's global motion. Here, we propose a recursive extension to the Bayesian framework for motion processing (Weiss, Simoncelli, \& Adelson, 2002) cascaded with a model oculomotor plant to describe the dynamic integration of 1D and 2D motion information in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements. In the recurrent Bayesian framework, the prior defined in the velocity space is combined with the two independent measurement likelihood functions, representing edge-related and terminator-related information, respectively to obtain the posterior. The prior is updated with the posterior at the end of each iteration step. The maximum-a posteriori ({MAP}) of the posterior distribution at every time step is fed into the oculomotor plant to produce eye velocity responses that are compared to the human smooth pursuit data. The recurrent model was tuned with the variance of pursuit responses to either "pure" 1D or "pure" 2D motion. The oculomotor plant was tuned with an independent set of oculomotor data, including the effects of line length (i.e. stimulus energy) and directional anisotropies in the smooth pursuit responses. The model not only provides an accurate qualitative account of dynamic motion integration but also a quantitative account that is close to the smooth pursuit response across several conditions (three contrasts and three speeds) for two human subjects.},

We have trained two monkeys to choose between a pair of coloured targets after viewing four shapes, shown sequentially, that governed the probability that one of the targets would furnish reward.

The theory proposes that input data are temporally grouped and used to predict and estimate the motion flows in the image sequence. This temporal grouping can be considered a generalization of the data association techniques that engineers use to study motion sequences. Our temporal grouping theory is expressed in terms of the Bayesian generalization of standard Kalman filtering. To implement the theory, we derive a parallel network that shares some properties of cortical networks. Computer simulations of this network demonstrate that our theory qualitatively accounts for psychophysical experiments on motion occlusion and motion outliers. In deriving our theory, we assumed spatial factorizability of the probability distributions and made the approximation of updating the marginal distributions of velocity at each point. This allowed us to perform local computations and simplified our implementation. We argue that these approximations are suitable for the stimuli we are considering (for which spatial coherence effects are negligible).},

In animals, behavioral variability is critical for the motor exploration required to select the action that optimizes reward and minimizes cost/punishment and is guided by dopamine ({DA}). The aim of this study was to test in humans whether low-level movement parameters are affected by punishment and reward in ways similar to high-level action selection. Moreover, we addressed the proposed dependence of behavioral and neurophysiological variability on {DA} and whether this may underpin the exploration of kinematic parameters. Participants performed an out-and-back index finger movement and were instructed that monetary reward and punishment were based on its maximal acceleration ({MA}). In fact, the feedback was not contingent on the participant's behavior but predetermined. Blocks highly biased toward punishment were associated with increased {MA} variability relative to blocks either with reward or without feedback. This increase in behavioral variability was positively correlated with neurophysiological variability, as measured by changes in corticospinal excitability with transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex. Following the administration of a {DA} antagonist, the variability associated with punishment diminished and the correlation between behavioral and neurophysiological variability no longer existed. Similar changes in variability were not observed when participants executed a predetermined {MA}, nor did {DA} influence resting neurophysiological variability. Thus, under conditions of punishment, {DA}-dependent processes influence the selection of low-level movement parameters. We propose that the enhanced behavioral variability reflects the exploration of kinematic parameters for less punishing, or conversely more rewarding, outcomes.},

The aim of this work is to develop a fully spike-based, biologically inspired mechanism for the translation of proprioceptive feedback. The translation is achieved by implementing a computational model of neural activity of type Ia and type {II} afferent fibers of muscle spindles, the primary source of proprioceptive information, which, in mammals is regulated through fusimotor activation and provides necessary adjustments during voluntary muscle contractions. As such, both static and dynamic γ-motoneurons activities are taken into account in the proposed model. Information from the actual proprioceptive sensors (i.e. motor encoders) is then used to simulate the spindle contraction and relaxation, and therefore drive the neural activity. To assess the feasibility of this approach, the model is implemented on the {NEST} spiking neural network simulator and on the {SpiNNaker} neuromorphic hardware platform and tested on simulated and physical robotic platforms. The results demonstrate that the model can be used in both simulated and real-time robotic applications to translate encoder values into a biologically plausible neural activity. Thus, this model provides a completely spike-based building block, suitable for neuromorphic platforms, that will enable the development of sensory-motor closed loops which could include neural simulations of areas of the central nervous system or of low-level reflexes.},

The answer to this question is crucial, as it dramatically constrains the sorts of computational and cognitive processes that the pulvinar might carry out. Here we used {fMRI} to test for position-sensitive encoding in the human pulvinar. Subjects passively viewed flickering Gabor stimuli, and as the spatial separation between Gabors increased, the correlation between patterns of activity across voxels within the right pulvinar decreased significantly.

Subjects intercepted white or patterned disks that moved from left to right across a large screen at various constant velocities while either visually tracking the target or fixating the position at which they were required to intercept the target. We biased retinal motion perception by moving the pattern within the patterned targets. This manipulation led to large systematic errors in interception when subjects were fixating, but not when they were tracking the target. The reduction in the errors did not depend on how smoothly the eyes were tracking the target shortly before intercepting it. We propose that tracking targets with one's eyes when one wants to intercept them makes one less susceptible to biases in judging their motion.},

While backward masking provides a classical example, the flash lag effect stimulates theorists with a variety of intriguing findings. The {TMS}-triggered scotoma together with "backward filling-in" of it offer a unique neuroscientific case. Findings suggest that various visual attributes are reorganized in a postdictive fashion to be consistent with each other, or to be consistent in a causality framework. In terms of the underlying mechanisms, four prototypical models have been considered: the "catch up," the "reentry," the "different pathway" and the "memory revision" models. By extending the list of postdictive phenomena to memory, sensory-motor and higher-level cognition, one may note that such a postdictive reconstruction may be a general principle of neural computation, ranging from milliseconds to months in a time scale, from local neuronal interactions to long-range connectivity, in the complex brain. The operational definition of the "postdictive phenomenon" can be applicable to such a wide range of sensory/cognitive effects across a wide range of time scale, even though the underlying neural mechanisms may vary across them. This has significant implications in interpreting "free will" and "sense of agency" in functional, psychophysical and neuroscientific terms.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we bring techniques from operations research to bear on the problem of choosing optimal actions in partially observable stochastic domains. We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes ({MDPS}) and partially observable {MDPS} ({POMDPS}). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving {POMDPS} off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a {POMDP}. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of finding exact solutions to {POMDPS}, and of some possibilities for finding approximate solutions. 0 1998 Consider the problem of a robot navigating in a large office building. The robot can move from hallway intersection to intersection and can make local observations of its world. Its actions are not completely reliable, however. Sometimes, when it intends to move, it stays where it is or goes too far; sometimes, when it intends to turn, it overshoots. It has similar problems with observation. Sometimes a corridor looks like a comer; sometimes a T-junction looks like an L-junction. How can such an error-plagued robot navigate, even given a map of the corridors? In general, the robot will have to remember something about its history of actions and observations and use this information, together with its knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the world (the map and other information), to maintain an estimate of its location. Many engineering applications follow this approach, using methods like the Kalman filter [26] to maintain a running estimate of the robot's spatial uncertainty, expressed as an ellipsoid or normal distribution in Cartesian space. This approach will not do for our robot, though. Its uncertainty may be discrete: it might be almost certain that it is in the northeast comer of either the fourth or the seventh floors, though it admits a chance that it is on the fifth floor, as well. Then, given an uncertain estimate of its location, the robot has to decide what actions to take. In some cases, it might be sufficient to ignore its uncertainty and take actions that would be appropriate for the most likely location. In other cases, it might be better for the robot to take actions for the purpose of gathering information, such as searching for a landmark or reading signs on the wall. In general, it will take actions that fulfill both purposes simultaneously.},

Starting from the old idea of perception as probabilistic inference, we show how to use knowledge of the psychophysical task to make testable predictions for the influence of feedback signals on early sensory representations. Applying our framework to a two-alternative forced choice task paradigm, we can explain multiple empirical findings that have been hard to account for by the traditional feedforward model of sensory processing, including the task dependence of neural response correlations and the diverging time courses of choice probabilities and psychophysical kernels. Our model makes new predictions and characterizes a component of correlated variability that represents task-related information rather than performance-degrading noise. It demonstrates a normative way to integrate sensory and cognitive components into physiologically testable models of perceptual decision-making.},

Here we report positional localization observed at motion offsets as well as at onsets. In the 'flash-lead' effect, a moving object is perceived to be behind a spatially concurrent stationary flash before the two disappear. With 'reverse-repmo', subjects mis-localize the final position of a moving bar in the direction opposite to the trajectory of motion. Finally, we demonstrate that simultaneous onset and offset effects lead to a perceived compression of visual space. By characterizing illusory effects observed at motion offsets as well as at onsets, we provide evidence that the perceived position of a moving object is the result of an averaging process over a short time period, weighted towards the most recent positions. Our account explains a variety of motion illusions, including the compression of moving shapes when viewed through apertures.},

Much as the information channels of instruments, such as radio telescopes, transmit signals which are processed according to various assumptions to give useful data, so neural signals are processed to give data for perception. To understand perception, the signal codes and the stored knowledge or assumptions used for deriving perceptual hypotheses must be discovered. Systematic perceptual errors are important clues for appreciating signal channel limitations, and for discovering hypothesis-generating procedures. Although this distinction between 'physiological' and 'cognitive' aspects of perception may be logically clear, it is in practice surprisingly difficult to establish which are responsible even for clearly established phenomena such as the classical distortion illusions. Experimental results are presented, aimed at distinguishing between and disconvering what happens when there is mismatch with the neural signal channel, and when neural signals are processed inappropriately for the current situation. This leads us to make some distinctions between perceptual and scientific hypotheses, which raise in a new form the problem: What are 'objects'?},

We describe a mathematical model which exploits the temporal structure of rapid sensory dynamics to track the slower trajectories of their underlying causes. This model establishes a proof of concept that slowly changing neuronal states can encode the trajectories of faster sensory signals. We link this hierarchical account to recent developments in the perception of human action; in particular artificial speech recognition. We argue that these hierarchical models of dynamical systems are a plausible starting point to develop robust recognition schemes, because they capture critical temporal dependencies induced by deep hierarchical structure. We conclude by suggesting that a fruitful computational neuroscience approach may emerge from modeling perception as non-autonomous recognition dynamics enslaved by autonomous hierarchical dynamics in the sensorium.},

	abstract = {An implicit, underlying assumption of most Helmholtzian/Bayesian approaches to perception is the hypothesis that the scene an observer perceives is the probable source of the proximal stimulus. There is, however, a nontrivial latency (on the order of 100 ms) between the time of a proximal stimulus and the time a visual percept is elicited. It seems plausible that it would be advantageous for an observer to have, at any time t, a percept representative of what is out there at that very time t, not a percept of the recent past. If this is so, it implies a modification to the implicit hypothesis underlying most existing probabilistic approaches to perception: the new hypothesis is that, given the proximal stimulus, the scene an observer perceives is the probable scene present at the time of the percept. That is, the hypothesis is that what an observer perceives is not the probable source of the proximal stimulus, but the probable way the probable source will be when the percept actually occurs. A model of an observer's typical movements in the world is developed, and it is shown that projected angles are perceived in a way consistent with the way the probable source will project to the eye after a small time period of forward movement by the observer. The predicted and actual direction of projected-angle misperception is sometimes toward 90ø and sometimes away from 90ø, depending on whether the probable source angle is lying in a plane parallel or perpendicular to the probable direction of motion, respectively. The perception of angular size for lines in a figure with cues they are lying in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion is also shown to fit the predictions of the model.},

For example, a spot of light can be characterized by its position, but it does not contribute any information about orientation. However, when moved fast enough, a continuous streak along its trajectory is perceived that helps to determine the orientation of the movement path. The question arises whether the processing of the trajectory and its orientation are simultaneously represented in the primary visual cortex. Here I show that decoding neural population activity within a two-dimensional parameter space represents both (1) physical input given by the actual position of the moving spot and (2) orientation. This latter parameter has no physical counterpart in the stimulus but must be actively formed by spatiotemporal integration of the spot's trajectory.},

In particular, this article demonstrates that (1) smaller sizes, (2) slower speeds, (3) greater luminance contrast, (4) farther distance, (5) lower eccentricity, (6) greater proximity to the vanishing point, and (7) greater proximity to the focus of expansion all tend to have similar perceptual effects, namely, to (A) increase perceived size, (B) increase perceived speed, (C) decrease perceived luminance contrast, and (D) decrease perceived distance. The detection of these empirical regularities was motivated by a hypothesis, called "perceiving the present," that the visual system possesses mechanisms for compensating neural delay during forward motion.

	abstract = {Neuronal interactions are an intricate part of cortical information processing generating internal representations of the environment beyond simple one-to-one mappings of the input parameter space. Here we examined functional ranges of interaction processes within ensembles of neurons in cat primary visual cortex. Seven "elementary" stimuli consisting of small squares of light were presented at contiguous horizontal positions. The population representation of these stimuli was compared to the representation of "composite" stimuli, consisting of two squares of light at varied separations. Based on receptive field measurements and by application of an Optimal Linear Estimator, the representation of retinal location was constructed as a distribution of population activation ({DPA}) in visual space. The spatiotemporal pattern of the {DPA} was investigated by obtaining the activity of each neuron for a sequence of time intervals. We found that the {DPA} of composite stimuli deviates from the superposition of its components because of distance-dependent (1) early excitation and (2) late inhibition. (3) The shape of the {DPA} of composite stimuli revealed a distance-dependent repulsion effect. We simulated these findings within the framework of dynamic neural fields. In the model, the feedforward response of neurons is modulated by spatial ranges of excitatory and inhibitory interactions within the population. A single set of model parameters was sufficient to describe the main experimental effects. Combined, our results indicate that the spatiotemporal processing of visual stimuli is characterized by a delicate, mutual interplay between stimulus-dependent and interaction-based strategies contributing to the formation of widespread cortical activation patterns.},

	abstract = {© 2018, Springer International Publishing {AG}. In order to yield satisfied image after denosing processing, the process of error tracing is nearly necessary for parameter selection. In practice, usually the choice of such parameters is time consuming and empirically dependant when a ground-truth reference is inavailable. Although some successful methods have been proposed in recent research, they still require certain parameters to be set a priori for parameter optimization. These methods tend to be strongly reliant on restrictive assumptions on the signal and noise of input image. In this paper, we propose a framework of parameter selection, which is based on subjective perceptive evaluation and implementated by a well-designed convolutional neural network. The proposed algorithm has the following advantages: (1) consistents with subjective perception, (2) does not require a reference image available, (3) with better capability of robustness and generalization, (4) trims the number of iteration of denosing in parameter selection. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms other methods in parameter selection. Our parameter trimming framework saves the computation of iterative image denoising up to 74\%.},

We measured responses of V1 and V2 cells to orientation mixtures and fit them with a model whose stimulus selectivity arises from the combined effects of filtering, suppression, and response nonlinearity. The model explains the diversity of orientation selectivity with neuron-to-neuron variability in all three mechanisms, of which variability in the orientation bandwidth of linear filtering is the most important. The model also accounts for the cells' diversity of spatial frequency selectivity. Tuning diversity is matched to the needs of visual encoding. The orientation content found in natural scenes is diverse, and neurons with different selectivities are adapted to different stimulus configurations. Single orientations are better encoded by highly selective neurons, while orientation mixtures are better encoded by less selective neurons. A diverse population of neurons therefore provides better overall discrimination capabilities for natural images than any homogeneous population. Neurons in primary visual cortex are selective for stimulus orientation, but the precision of this selectivity differs across neurons. Using novel stimuli and a computational "cascade" model, Goris et al. shed light on the origins and purpose of this diversity.},

	abstract = {When a flash is aligned with a moving object, subjects perceive the flash to lag behind the moving object. Two different models have been proposed to explain this "flash-lag" effect. In the motion extrapolation model, the visual system extrapolates the location of the moving object to counteract neural propagation delays, whereas in the latency difference model, it is hypothesized that moving objects are processed and perceived more quickly than flashed objects. However, recent psychophysical experiments suggest that neither of these interpretations is feasible (Eagleman \& Sejnowski, 2000a, 2000b, 2000c), hypothesizing instead that the visual system uses data from the future of an event before committing to an interpretation. We formalize this idea in terms of the statistical framework of optimal smoothing and show that a model based on smoothing accounts for the shape of psychometric curves from a flash-lag experiment involving random reversals of motion direction. The smoothing model demonstrates how the visual system may enhance perceptual accuracy by relying not only on data from the past but also on data collected from the immediate future of an event.},

	abstract = {In natural perception, different items (objects) in a scene are rarely equally relevant to the observer. The brain improves performance by directing attention to the most relevant items, for example the ones most likely to be probed. For a general set of probing probabilities, it is not known how attentional resources should be allocated to maximize performance. Here, we investigate the optimal strategy for allocating a fixed resource budget E among N items when on each trial, only one item gets probed. We develop an efficient algorithm that, for any concave utility function, reduces the N-dimensional problem to a set of N one-dimensional problems that the brain could plausibly solve. We find that the intuitive strategy of allocating resource in proportion to the probing probabilities is in general not optimal. In particular, in some tasks, if resource is low, the optimal strategy involves allocating zero resource to items with a nonzero probability of being probed. Our work opens the door to normatively guided studies of attentional allocation.},

This is a challenging problem because machines are different and change characteristics over time due to wear and maintenance. The efficiency and scalability of conventional condition monitoring methods are limited by the need for manual analysis and re-configuration. The problem to extract relevant features from condition monitoring signals and thereby detect and analyze changes in such signals is a central issue, which in principle can be addressed using machine learning methods. Former work demonstrates that dictionary learning can be used to automatically derive signal features that characterize different operational conditions and faults of a rotating machine, but the use of such methods for online condition monitoring purposes is an open problem. Here we investigate online learning of features using dictionary learning. We describe dictionary distance and signal fidelity based heuristics for anomaly detection, and we study the time-propagated features and sparse approximation of vibration and acoustic emission signals in three different case studies. We present results of numerical experiments with different hyperparameters affecting the approximation accuracy, computational cost, and the adaptation rate of the learned features. We find that the learned features change slowly under normal variations of the operational conditions in comparison to the rapid adaptation observed when a fault appears (bearing defects, magnetite particles in the lubricant, or plastic deformation of steel). Furthermore, we find that a sparse signal approximation with 2.5\% preserved coefficients based on a propagated dictionary is sufficient for bearing defect detection.},

	abstract = {Recently, we and several other authors have written about the possibilities of using stochastic approximation techniques for fitting variational approximations to intractable Bayesian posterior distributions. Naive implementations of stochastic approximation suffer from high variance in this setting. Several authors have therefore suggested using control variates to reduce this variance, while we have taken a different but analogous approach to reducing the variance which we call stochastic linear regression. In this note we take the former perspective and derive the ideal set of control variates for stochastic approximation variational Bayes under a certain set of assumptions. We then show that using these control variates is closely related to using the stochastic linear regression approximation technique we proposed earlier. A simple example shows that our method for constructing control variates leads to stochastic estimators with much lower variance compared to other approaches.},

Based on a probabilistic framework, we investigated the alternative hypothesis that time is used for gradually refining an internal estimate of uncertainty, that is to obtain an increasingly accurate approximation of the posterior distribution through collecting samples from it. In the context of a simple orientation estimation task, we analytically derived predictions of how humans should behave under the two hypotheses, and identified the across-trial correlation between error and subjective uncertainty as a proper assay to distinguish between them. Next, we developed a novel experimental paradigm that could be used to reliably measure these quantities, and tested the predictions derived from the two hypotheses. We found that in our task, humans show clear evidence that they use time mostly for probabilistic sampling and not for evidence integration. These results provide the first empirical support for iteratively improving probabilistic representations in perceptual decision making, and open the way to reinterpret the role of time in the cortical processing of complex sensory information.},

	abstract = {We present data and argument to show that in Tetris-a real-time, interactive video game-certain cognitive and perceptual problems are more quicklv, easily, and reliably solved by performing actions in the world than by performing computational actions in the head alone. We have found that some of the translations and rotations made by players of this video game are best understood as actions that use the world to improve cognition. These actions are not used to implement a plan, or to implement a reaction; they are used to change the world in order to simplify the problem-solving task. Thus, we distinguish pragmatic actions-actions performed to bring one physically closer to a goal-from epistemic actions -actions performed to uncover informatioan that is hidden or hard to compute mentally. To illustrate the need for epistemic actions, we first develop a standard information-processing model of Tetris cognition and show that it cannot explain performance data from human players of the game-even when we relax the assumption of fully sequential processing. Standard models disregard many actions taken by players because they appear unmotivated or superfluous. However, we show that such actions are actually far from superfluous; they play a valuable role in improving human performance. We argue that traditional accounts are limited because they regard action as having a single function: to change the world. By recognizing a second function of action-an epistemic function-we can explain many of the actions that a traditional model cannot. Although our argument is supported by numerous examples specifically from Tetris, we outline how the new category of epistemic action can be incorporated into theories of action more generally. © 1994.},

One explanation for this phenomenon is that there is a difference in the persistence of the flash and the bar. Another explanation is that the visual system compensates for the neural delays of processing visual motion information, such as the moving bar, by spatially extrapolating the bar's perceived location forward in space along its expected trajectory. Two experiments demonstrate that neither of these models is tenable. The first experiment masked the flash one video frame after its presentation. The flash was still perceived to lag behind the bar, suggesting that a difference in the persistence of the flash and bar, does not cause the apparent offset. The second experiment employed unpredictable changes in the velocity of the bar including an abrupt reversal, disappearance, acceleration, and deceleration. If the extrapolation model held, the bar would continue to be extrapolated in accordance with its initial velocity until the moment of an abrupt velocity change. The results were inconsistent with this prediction, suggesting that there is little or no spatial compensation for the neural delays of processing moving objects. The results support a new model of temporal facilitation for moving objects whereby the apparent flash lag is due to a latency advantage for moving over flashed stimuli.},

Although the absolute magnitude of mislocalization increased with motion speed, the convergence point remained unaffected. The motion modified the perceived position of a flash, but had little influence on the perceived shape of a spatially extended flash stimulus.

We show that learning of predictive structures relates to individual decision strategy; that is, selecting the most probable outcome in a given context (maximizing) versus matching the exact sequence statistics. These strategies engage distinct human brain regions: maximizing engages dorsolateral prefron-tal, cingulate, sensory–motor regions, and basal ganglia (dorsal caudate, putamen), whereas matching engages occipitotemporal regions (in-cluding the hippocampus) and basal ganglia (ventral caudate).

	abstract = {When human observers are exposed to even slight motion signals followed by brief visual transients–stimuli containing no detectable coherent motion signals–they perceive large and salient illusory jumps. This visually striking effect, which we call "high phi," challenges well-entrenched assumptions about the perception of motion, namely the minimal-motion principle and the breakdown of coherent motion perception with steps above an upper limit called dmax. Our experiments with transients, such as texture randomization or contrast reversal, show that the magnitude of the jump depends on spatial frequency and transient duration–but not on the speed of the inducing motion signals–and the direction of the jump depends on the duration of the inducer. Jump magnitude is robust across jump directions and different types of transient. In addition, when a texture is actually displaced by a large step beyond the upper step size limit of dmax, a breakdown of coherent motion perception is expected; however, in the presence of an inducer, observers again perceive coherent displacements at or just above dmax. In summary, across a large variety of stimuli, we find that when incoherent motion noise is preceded by a small bias, instead of perceiving little or no motion–as suggested by the minimal-motion principle–observers perceive jumps whose amplitude closely follows their own dmax limits.},

Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current “run,” or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

	abstract = {When a brief static flash is presented in physical alignment with a moving target, the position of the flash can seem to lag behind that of the moving target. Various explanations exist. One of the most popular is the differential latency hypothesis. This assumes that neural latencies for moving stimuli are shorter than those for static stimuli. Accordingly, the flash lag would occur because perception is temporally fragmented, with moving stimuli seen before static. To test this, observers were asked to make different judgments concerning the same stimulus. Observers either judged if color changes in moving and static stimulus sections were synchronous, or whether the different stimulus sections were aligned at the time of a color change. If the flash-lag were driven by a simple differential latency, we would expect both judgments to be marked by a temporal advantage for moving stimuli. Our results suggest the contrary, as only the later judgment was marked by a flash-lag effect. The apparent timing of moving and static color changes was veridical. However, when we introduced a systematic differential latency, by modulating image contrast, both judgments were affected. Our data therefore suggest that a simple differential can modulate flash-lag type effects, but they do not cause the phenomenon.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.10219},
	abstract = {Two geometrical structures have been extensively studied for a manifold of probability distributions. One is based on the Fisher information metric, which is invariant under reversible transformations of random variables, while the other is based on the Wasserstein distance of optimal transportation, which reflects the structure of the distance between random variables. Here, we propose a new information-geometrical theory that is a unified framework connecting the Wasserstein distance and Kullback-Leibler ({KL}) divergence. We primarily considered a discrete case consisting of \$n\$ elements and studied the geometry of the probability simplex $_{\textrm{n-1}}$, which is the set of all probability distributions over \$n\$ elements. The Wasserstein distance was introduced in $_{\textrm{n-1}}$ by the optimal transportation of commodities from distribution \${\textbackslash}mathbfp\$ to distribution \${\textbackslash}mathbfq\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbfp\$, \${\textbackslash}mathbfq ın S\_n-1\$. We relaxed the optimal transportation by using entropy, which was introduced by Cuturi. The optimal solution was called the entropy-relaxed stochastic transportation plan. The entropy-relaxed optimal cost \$C({\textbackslash}mathbfp, {\textbackslash}mathbfq)\$ was computationally much less demanding than the original Wasserstein distance but does not define a distance because it is not minimized at \${\textbackslash}mathbfp={\textbackslash}mathbfq\$. To define a proper divergence while retaining the computational advantage, we first introduced a divergence function in the manifold \$S\_n-1 {\textbackslash}times S\_n-1\$ of optimal transportation plans. We fully explored the information geometry of the manifold of the optimal transportation plans and subsequently constructed a new one-parameter family of divergences in $_{\textrm{n-1}}$ that are related to both the Wasserstein distance and the {KL}-divergence.},

Here we demonstrate that layer {IV} simple cells and layer {II} and {III} complex cells show correlated firing consistent with monosynaptic connections.

In this kind of task, biased sampling occurs because samples are obtained from specific trajectories dictated by the dynamics of the environment and are usually concentrated in particular convergence regions, which in the long term tend to dominate the approximation in the less sampled regions. The nonstationarity comes from the recursive nature of the estimations typical of temporal difference methods. This nonstationarity has a local profile, varying not only along the learning process but also along different regions of the state space. We propose to deal with these problems using an estimation of the probability density of samples represented with a gaussian mixture model. To deal with the nonstationarity problem, we use the common approach of introducing a forgetting factor in the updating formula. However, instead of using the same forgetting factor ...},

	abstract = {Two general approaches to the visual control of action have emerged in last few decades, known as the on-line and model-based approaches. The key difference between them is whether action is controlled by current visual information or on the basis of an internal world model. In this paper, we evaluate three hypotheses: strong on-line control, strong model-based control, and a hybrid solution that combines on-line control with weak off-line strategies. We review experimental research on the control of locomotion and manual actions, which indicates that (a) an internal world model is neither sufficient nor necessary to control action at normal levels of performance; (b) current visual information is necessary and sufficient to control action at normal levels; and (c) under certain conditions (e.g. occlusion) action is controlled by less accurate, simple strategies such as heuristics, visual-motor mappings, or spatial memory. We conclude that the strong model-based hypothesis is not sustainable. Action is normally controlled on-line when current information is available, consistent with the strong on-line control hypothesis. In exceptional circumstances, action is controlled by weak, context-specific, off-line strategies. This hybrid solution is comprehensive, parsimonious, and able to account for a variety of tasks under a range of visual conditions.},

Initially thought to be generated randomly, it has recently been established that microsaccades are influenced by sensory stimuli, attentional processes, and certain cognitive states. Whether decision processes influence microsaccades, however, is unknown. Here, we adapted two classic economic tasks to examine whether microsaccades reflect evolving saccade decisions. Volitional saccade choices of monkey and human subjects provided a measure of the subjective value of targets. Importantly, analyses occurred during a period of complete darkness to minimize the known influence of sensory and attentional processes on microsaccades. As the time of saccadic choice approached, microsaccade direction became the following: 1) biased toward targets as a function of their subjective value and 2) predictive of upcoming, voluntary choice. Our results indicate that microsaccade direction is influenced by and is a reliable tell of evolving saccade decisions. Our results are consistent with dynamic decision processes within the midbrain superior colliculus; that is, microsaccade direction is influenced by the transition of activity toward caudal saccade regions associated with high saccade value and/or future saccade choice.},

To test whether these structures have distinct roles in decision making, single-neuron activity was recorded from each structure while monkeys executed an ocular go/nogo task. The task rule is to pursue a moving target if it intersects a visible square or "go zone." We found that most {SEF} neurons showed differential go/nogo activity during the delay period, before the target intersected the go zone (delay period), whereas most {FEF} neurons did so after target intersection, during the period in which the movement was executed (movement period). Choice probability ({CP}) for {SEF} neurons was high in the delay period but decreased in the movement period, whereas for {FEF} neurons it was low in the delay period and increased in the movement period. Directional selectivity of {SEF} neurons was low throughout the trial, whereas that of {FEF} neurons was highest in the delay period, decreasing later in the trial. Increasing task difficulty led to later discrimination between go and nogo in both structures and lower {CP} in the {SEF}, but it did not affect {CP} in the {FEF}. The results suggest that the {SEF} interprets the task rule early but is less involved in executing the motor decision than is the {FEF} and that these two areas collaborate dynamically to execute ocular decisions.},

Different images might have different intrinsic values. Optimal control theory predicts that the intrinsic value that the brain assigns to targets of saccades should be reflected in the trajectory of the saccade. That is, in anticipation of foveating a highly valued image, our brain should produce a saccade with a higher velocity and shorter duration. Here, we considered four types of images: faces, objects, inverted faces, and meaningless visual noise. Indeed, we found that reflexive saccades that were made to a laser light in anticipation of viewing an image of a face had the highest velocities and shortest durations. The intrinsic value of visual information appears to have a small but significant influence on the motor commands that guide saccades.},

	abstract = {We commonly think of motor learning as a gradual process that makes small, adaptive steps in a consistent direction. We now report evidence that learning in pursuit eye movements could start with large, transient short-term alterations that stoke a more gradual long-term process. Monkeys tracked a target that started moving horizontally or vertically. After 250 ms of motion had produced a preinstruction eye velocity close to target velocity, an orthogonal component of target motion created an instructive change in target direction that was randomly in one of the two directions along the orthogonal axis. The preinstruction eye velocity in each trial expressed single-trial learning as a bias toward the direction of the instruction in the prior trial. The single-trial learning was forgotten within 4 to 10 s. Two observations implied that single-trial learning was not simply cognitive anticipation. First, the magnitude of the trial-over-trial change in eye velocity depended on the ongoing eye velocity at the time of the instruction in the prior trial. Single-trial learning was negligible if the prior trial had provided a well-timed cue without evoking any preinstruction eye velocity. Second, regular alternation of the direction of the instructive target motion caused reactive rather than anticipatory trial-over-trial changes in eye velocity. Humans showed very different responses that appeared to be based on cognitive anticipation rather than learning. We suggest that single-trial learning results from a low-level learning mechanism and may be a necessary prerequisite for longer-term modifications that are more permanent.},

The targets jumped 2 deg to one side and returned at a constant velocity. Targets were single round targets or extended targets with a high edge content. Many subjects showed substantial smooth eye movement responses in the passive condition, suggesting that a substantial component of initial smooth movement responses can occur independent of attention. Additional features of the smooth eye movement responses included (i) oculomotor "twitches" (brief, short-latency smooth eye movements in the step direction), (ii) overshoots (eye velocity greater than target velocity) and (iii) oscillations. Most of the response features can be accounted for by a model with a gain that is dependent on the subject's attentional level and on stimulus parameters. © 1987.},

The aim of this study was to investigate affective {ToM} and decision making in patients with {PD} and healthy controls ({HC}) in a task assessing affective {ToM} (Reading the Mind in the Eyes, {RME}) and two decision-making tasks (Iowa Gambling Task, {IGT}; Game of Dice Task, {GDT}). Consistent with previous findings, patients with {PD} were impaired in the affective {ToM} task, and when making decisions under ambiguity and in risk situations. The score of emotion recognition in the {RME} task was negatively correlated with the severity of the disease and positively correlated with the total number of advantageous cards chosen in the {IGT}. However, the final capital in the {GDT} was correlated with memory impairment. The present study implies that affective {ToM} and decision making under ambiguity may share similar neural mechanisms, while decision making under ambiguity and decision making under risk may involve processing within different neural networks.},

Information about reward is not only used to optimize decisions but also for movement preparation to minimize reaction times to rewarded targets. Here, we show that this is especially true in contexts in which participants additionally have to choose between different options. We probed eye movement preparation by measuring saccade latencies to differently rewarded single targets (single-trial) appearing left or right from fixation. In choice-trials, both targets were displayed and participants were free to decide for one target to receive the corresponding reward. In blocks without choice-trials, single-trial latencies were not or only weakly affected by reward. With choice-trials present, the influence of reward increased with the proportion and difficulty of choices and decreased when a cue indicated that no choice will be necessary. Choices caused a delay in subsequent single-trial responses to the non-chosen option. Taken together, our results suggest that reward affects saccade preparation mainly when the outcome is uncertain and depends on the participants' behavior, for instance when they have to choose between targets differing in reward.},

	abstract = {A critical component of decision making is the ability to adjust criteria for classifying stimuli. {fMRI} and drift diffusion models were used to explore the neural representations of perceptual criteria in decision making. The specific focus was on the relative engagement of perceptual- and decision-related neural systems in response to adjustments in perceptual criteria. Human participants classified visual stimuli as big or small based on criteria of different sizes, which effectively biased their choices toward one response over the other. A drift diffusion model was fit to the behavioral data to extract estimates of stimulus size, criterion size, and difficulty for each participant and condition. These parameter values were used as modulated regressors to create a highly constrained model for the {fMRI} analysis that accounted for several components of the decision process. The results show that perceptual criteria values were reflected by activity in left inferior temporal cortex, a region known to represent objects and their physical properties, whereas stimulus size was reflected by activation in occipital cortex. A frontoparietal network of regions, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and superior parietal lobule, corresponded to the decision variables resulting from the downstream stimulus-criterion comparison, independent of stimulus type. The results provide novel evidence that perceptual criteria are represented in stimulus space and serve as inputs to be compared with the presented stimulus, recruiting a common network of decision regions shown to be active in other simple decisions. This work advances our understanding of the neural correlates of decision flexibility and adjustments of behavioral bias.},

	abstract = {The motion aftereffect ({MAE}) lasts longer when the test period does not immediately follow adaptation, a phenomenon called storage. Does storage of the {MAE} occur if the test target is present but rendered phenomenally invisible owing to the presence of a rival target presented to the other eye during the storage period? Our experiment addressed this question. Following adaptation to a drifting grating, an intervening period preceded testing with a stationary grating. During this period, the adapted eye either viewed the test target immediately or was occluded, and the unadapted eye either viewed a high-contrast rival target or was occluded. Thus four conditions were employed. The duration of the residual {MAE} was found to be longer for the rivalry condition (grating and rival target viewed) than for the normal {MAE} condition (grating viewed), and comparable to that in the stored {MAE} condition (both eyes occluded). Thus, the {MAE} is stored when the test target is rendered invisible due to binocular rivalry, indicating that a suppressed target is ineffective at promoting decay of the {MAE}. So while suppression does not prevent information about the adapting grating from reaching the site of generation of the {MAE} (Lehmkuhle \& Fox, 1975), it can prevent information about the test target from reaching the site of the stored {MAE}. Current models attribute the {MAE} to reduced responsiveness of direction-selective cortical neurons (Sutherland, 1961; Barlow \& Hill, 1963). Thus, storage should reflect a differential return of these adapted cells to preadapted response levels, dependent on postadaptation stimulation.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

It was predicted that the {SCZ}+ group and the {OCD} group would show impairments in {OBF} function, as compared to the {SCZ}- group, and that the {SCZ}+ and {SCZ}- groups would show impairments in {DLPF} function, as compared to the {OCD} group.

Contrary to expectation, no divergence between groups was seen on tests of executive function. Instead, there was a statistical trend for the {SCZ}+ and {SCZ}- groups, when combined, to perform worse than individuals with {OCD} on the measure of {OBF}. Although not significant at the designated alpha level, the profile results showed that the {SCZ}+ group performed slightly below the {OCD} and {SCZ}- groups across nearly all neuropsychological domains. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The prospect of immediate reward elicits goal-oriented behavior. However, animals often have to perform actions that do not immediately lead to reward in the pursuit of a long-term goal. Here we identify neural activity in monkey caudate nucleus that specifically correlates with rewarded and unrewarded eye movements. The monkey performed a visually guided saccade task in which only one position was associated with positive reinforcement. To advance in the experimental session, however, the monkey had no choice but to complete a saccade to an unrewarded position as well as to a rewarded position. Some caudate saccadic neurons showed enhanced activity around the time of the saccade in rewarded trials (rewarded-saccade neurons). Another subset of neurons discharged selectively around the execution of the saccade in unrewarded trials (unrewarded-saccade neurons). In both rewarded and unrewarded trials, stronger activity of these neurons was associated with reduced saccade latency. These results suggest that both rewarded and unrewarded saccades are facilitated by caudate saccadic activity. The neuronal activity of unrewarded-saccade neurons might reflect the required execution of unrewarded eye movements on the way to future reward.},

Because there is evidence that a common motion-processing stage subserves perception and pursuit (e.g., Watamaniuk \& Heinen, 1999), either pursuit should be similarly impaired in discriminating acceleration or it must receive input from a system different from the one that processes visual motion for perception. We assessed the sensitivity of pursuit to acceleration or speed, and compared the results with those obtained in perceptual experiments done with similar stimuli and tasks. Specifically, observers pursued or made psychophysical judgments of targets that moved at randomly selected base speeds and subsequent accelerations. Oculomotor and psychophysical discrimination were compared by analyzing performance for the entire stimulus set sorted by either target acceleration or speed. Thresholds for pursuit and perception were higher for target acceleration than speed, further evidence that a common motion-processing stage limits the performance of both systems.},

Methods: Using baseline scores from 4 clinical trials, we identified relevant items that assessed Parkinson's disease psychosis to create a shortened version of the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms. We then analyzed the validity and treatment sensitivity of the shortened scale. Principal component analyses evaluated the underlying structure. Scores were compared across age, gender, trial, cognition, and country of origin. Sensitivity to change was assessed by comparing change in psychosis scores to the clinical global impression of improvement score, and effect sizes were calculated to evaluate treatment response. Results: Nine items were selected based on face-validity and symptom frequency. Principal component analysis yielded a 4-factor structure and identified delusions and visual, auditory, and somatic hallucinations as distinct constructs. Baseline total scores were similar across study, gender, region, and age group. The clinically meaningful change in the shortened scale, defined as a 1-unit change in clinical global impression, was 2.33 points, and the effect size was -0.722.

We first derive closed-form analytic solutions for the mean and variance of a diffusion model {RT} distribution. Next, we study how systematic differences in two important diffusion model parameters simultaneously affect the mean and the variance of the diffusion model {RT} distribution. Within the range of plausible values for the drift rate parameter, the relation between {RT} mean and {RT} standard deviation is approximately linear. Manipulation of the boundaryseparation parameter also leads to an approximately linear relation between {RT} mean and {RT} standard deviation, but only for low values of the drift rate parameter.},

The {MAE} lasts longer when the test pattern is not immediately or not continuously presented after adaptation. This phenomenon is called storage. So far research indicates that storage only occurs when textured visual stimulation is absent during part of the test phase or if the processing of a stationary test stimulus is prevented (e.g. by binocular rivalry). We present evidence that storage-like phenomena can occur even while a textured and moving visual stimulus is phenomenally present. We adapted binocularly to uni-directional motion of a random-pixel array M1 for 60 sec. This stimulus was immediately followed by another moving pattern M2. Its motion direction was orthogonal to that of M1. The presentation time of M2 was the independent variable. A stationary pattern was presented immediately after presentation of M2. The direction of the resulting integrated uni-directional {MAE} was measured. For short presentation times of M2 there is an integrated uni-directional {MAE}, which shows an interaction of the output of units stimulated by both moving patterns. However, it appeared that the effect of M1 on the direction of this combined uni-directional {MAE} is much longer present than would be expected from the {MAE} duration of M1, when tested in isolation. © 1994.},

We tested whether the {LATER} model can also be applied to the sequences of saccades in a multiple fixation search, during which latencies of second and subsequent saccades are typically shorter than that of the initial saccade. We found that the distributions of the reciprocal latencies for later saccades, unlike those of the first saccade, are highly asymmetrical, much like a gamma distribution. This suggests that the normal distribution of the rate r, which the {LATER} model assumes, is not appropriate to describe the rate distributions of subsequent saccades in a scanning sequence. By contrast, the gamma distribution is also appropriate to describe the distribution of reciprocal latencies for the first saccade. The change of the gamma distribution parameters as a function of the ordinal number of the saccade suggests a lowering of the threshold for second and later saccades, as well as a reduction in the number of target elements analysed.},

To dissociate those 2 possibilities, the authors required participants (N = 6) to generate pointing movements with a mass that either resisted or assisted limb motion. With practice, participants were able to generate pointing responses with very similar kinematics but whose kinetics varied in a systematic manner. The results showed that saccadic output was altered by the amount of force required to move the arm, consistent with an influence from limb kinetic signals. Because the interaction occurred before the pointing response began, the authors conclude that a predictive signal related to limb kinetics modulates saccadic output during tasks requiring eye-hand coordination.},

	abstract = {The predictive component of human smooth pursuit was studied by perturbing sinusoidal target motion at unpredictable instants. The disturbances consisted of either a brief period of stabilization of the target on the fovea or a replacement of the sine by a ramp displacement for half a period. To minimize the effects of a possible change of the tracking strategy by the subject the transitions were masked and only the initial part of the response to the disturbance was analyzed. After stabilization on the fovea the eye oscillation continued at the frequency of the preceding target movement for about one half-cycle, whereupon the oscillation was rapidly damped. The mean unidirectional smooth eye acceleration was 70\% of the mean unidirectional target acceleration prior to the stabilization. This suggests that during pursuit of a sinusoidal target movement about 75\% of the oculomotor response is generated by predictive processes. When the sine was replaced by a ramp, starting at the velocity zero-crossing, the eye accelerated away from the target for ca. 180 ms irrespective of the frequency of prior tracking. In contrast, when the ramp started at the peak velocity of the sinusoidal target motion the eye accelerated away from the target for more than a quarter period. After foveal stabilization during pursuit of a pseudorandom stimulus, the eye continued to oscillate for less than one period at approximately the highest frequency present in the stimulus. The frequency characteristics of human smooth pursuit of predictable as well as unpredictable target motion were correctly simulated by a model, which derived its predictive properties from a lead element, tuned to the current frequency of the target motion.},

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2009-25118-013[/rid]). Objective: To assess road safety and its predictors in drivers with Parkinson disease ({PD}). Methods: Licensed, active drivers with {PD} (n = 84; age = 67.3 ± 7.8, median Hoehn \& Yahr stage {II}) and controls (n = 182; age = 67.6 ± 7.5) underwent cognitive, visual, and motor tests, and drove a standardized route in urban and rural settings in an instrumented vehicle. Safety errors were judged and documented by a driving expert based on video data review. Results: Drivers with {PD} committed more total safety errors compared to controls (41.6 ± 14.6 vs 32.9 ± 12.3, p  0.0001); 77.4\% of drivers with {PD} committed more errors than the median total error count of the controls (medians: {PD} = 39.5, controls = 31.0). Lane violations were the most common error category in both groups. Group differences in some error categories became insignificant after results were adjusted for demographics and familiarity with the local driving environment. The {PD} group performed worse on tests of motor, cognitive, and visual abilities. Within the {PD} group, older age and worse performances on tests of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, attention, visuospatial abilities, visual memory, and general cognition predicted error counts. Measures of visual processing speed and attention and far visual acuity were jointly predictive of error counts in a multivariate model. Conclusions: Overall, drivers with Parkinson disease ({PD}) had poorer road safety compared to controls, but there was considerable variability among the drivers with {PD}, and some performed normally. Familiarity with the driving environment was a mitigating factor against unsafe driving in {PD}. Impairments in visual perception and cognition were associated with road safety errors in drivers with {PD}. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2016 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

Reduced {CS} contributed to deficits on tests of spatial and motion perception and attention in participants with {PD}. Impairments in visual attention and spatial perception predicted worse cognitive function. Worse performances on tests of visual speed of processing and attention, spatial and motion perception, visual construction, and executive functions correlated with measures of postural instability and gait difficulty (in the Motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale). Impairments in motor function, visual memory, mood, and executive functions predicted worse disability as measured by Schwab-England Activities of Daily Living Scale. {CONCLUSIONS}: Patients with mild to moderate Parkinson disease showed impaired visual perception and cognition compared with elderly control subjects.

	abstract = {We have used the initiation of pursuit eye movements as a tool to reveal properties of motion processing in the neural pathways that provide inputs to the human pursuit system. Horizontal and vertical eye position were recorded with a magnetic search coil in six normal adults. Stimuli were provided by individual trials of ramp target motion. Analysis was restricted to the first 100 ms of eye movement, which precedes the onset of corrective feedback. By recording the transient response to target motion at speeds the pursuit motor system can achieve, we investigated the visual properties of images that initiate pursuit. We have found effects of varying the retinal location, the direction, the velocity, the intensity, and the size of the stimulus. Eye acceleration in the first 100 ms of pursuit depended on both the direction of target motion and the initial position of the moving target. For horizontal target motion, eye acceleration was highest if the stimulus was close to the center of the visual field and moved toward the vertical meridian. For vertical target motion, eye acceleration was highest when the stimulus moved upward or downward within the lower visual field. The shape of the relationship between eye acceleration and initial target position was similar for target velocities ranging from 1.0 to 45 degrees/s. The initiation of pursuit showed two components that had different visual properties and were expressed early and late in the first 100 ms of pursuit. In the first 20 ms, instantaneous eye acceleration was in the direction of target motion but did not depend on other visual properties of the stimulus. At later times (e.g., 80-100 ms after pursuit initiation), instantaneous eye acceleration was strongly dependent on each property we tested. Targets that started close to and moved toward the position of fixation evoked the highest eye accelerations. For high-intensity targets, eye acceleration increased steadily as target velocity increased. For low-intensity targets, eye acceleration was selective for target velocities of 30-45 degrees/s. The properties of pursuit initiation in humans, including the differences between the early and late components, are remarkably similar to those reported by Lisberger and Westbrook (12) in monkeys. Our data provide evidence that the cell populations responsible for motion processing are similar in humans and monkeys and imply that the functional organization of the visual cortex is similar in the two species.},

Experiment 2 evaluated subsequent self-administration behavior on fixed- and progressive-ratio schedules of reinforcement. The results showed that prior yoked exposure to cocaine reduced subsequent drug-taking behavior on a progressive-ratio but not on a fixed-ratio schedule. Finally, Experiment 3 used a choice test to determine the impact of yoked drug delivery on the relative preference for cocaine versus water. The results showed that rats with a history of self-administering cocaine preferred to perform operant behaviors on the side of the chamber previously paired with cocaine, whereas the rats with a history of yoked delivery of cocaine avoided this side. These data show that, in most rats, the unpredictable, uncontrollable delivery of cocaine protects against the subsequent motivation for cocaine through an aversive mechanism.},

It is an important feature for distinguishing materials by means of touch. In order to quantitatively describe the ability of human observers to discriminate between materials on the basis of heat extraction rate, we conducted an experiment in which this heat extraction was performed in a controlled way. In different conditions, subjects were repeatedly asked to select from two stimuli the one that cooled faster. The discrimination threshold was around 43\% of the extraction rate. A rate that was twice as slow also yielded twice the absolute threshold. When we halved the temperature difference between the beginning and end of the stimulus, the threshold did not change as much. In separate experiments, we investigated the different cues that were available in the stimulus: initial cooling rate and end temperature. Both cues were used for discrimination, but cooling rate seemed to be the most important.},

	abstract = {1. The latency between the appearance of a popout search display and the eye movement to the oddball target of the display varies from trial to trial in both humans and monkeys. The source of the delay and variability of reaction time is unknown but has been attributed to as yet poorly defined decision processes. 2. We recorded neural activity in the frontal eye field ({FEF}), an area regarded as playing a central role in producing purposeful eye movements, of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performing a popout visual search task. Eighty-four neurons with visually evoked activity were analyzed. Twelve of these neurons had a phasic response associated with the presentation of the visual stimulus. The remaining neurons had more tonic responses that persisted through the saccade. Many of the neurons with more tonic responses resembled visuomovement cells in that they had activity that increased before a saccade into their response field. 3. The visual response latencies of {FEF} neurons were determined with the use of a Poisson spike train analysis. The mean visual latency was 67 ms (minimum = 35 ms, maximum = 138 ms). The visual response latencies to the target presented alone, to the target presented with distractors, or to the distractors did not differ significantly. 4. The initial visual activation of {FEF} neurons does not discriminate the target from the distractors of a popout visual search stimulus array, but the activity evolves to a state that discriminates whether the target of the search display is within the receptive field. We tested the hypothesis that the source of variability of saccade latency is the time taken by neurons involved in saccade programming to select the target for the gaze shift. 5. With the use of an analysis adapted from signal detection theory, we determined when the activity of single {FEF} neurons can reliably indicate whether the target or distractors are present within their response fields. The time of target discrimination partitions the reaction time into a perceptual stage in which target discrimination takes place, and a motor stage in which saccade programming and generation take place. The time of target discrimination occurred most often between 120 and 150 ms after stimulus presentation. 6. We analyzed the time course of target discrimination in the activity of single cells after separating trials into short, medium, and long saccade latency groups. Saccade latency was not correlated with the duration of the perceptual stage but was correlated with the duration of the motor stage. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the time taken for target discrimination, as indexed by {FEF} neurons, accounts for the wide variability in the time of movement initiation. 7. We conclude that the variability observed in saccade latencies during a simple visual search task is largely due to postperceptual motor processing following target discrimination. Signatures of both perceptual and postperceptual processing are evident in {FEF}. Procrastination in the output stage may prevent stereotypical behavior that would be maladaptive in a changing environment.},

The outcomes assigned to target and penalty regions and the spatial arrangement of those regions were varied. Subjects preferred configurations with higher expected gain whether selection involved a rapid pointing movement or a choice by key press. Movements executed to select one of two goal configurations exhibited the same movement dynamics as pointing movements directed at a single configuration, and were executed with the same high efficiency. Our results suggest that humans choose near-optimal strategies when planning their movement, and can base their selection of strategy on a rapid judgment about the expected gain associated with possible movement goals.},

Here we report that a goal-directed eye movement toward a uniquely colored object is disrupted by the appearance of a new but task-irrelevant object, unless subjects have a sufficient amount of time to focus their attention on the location of the target prior to the appearance of the new object. In many instances, the eyes started moving toward the new object before gaze started to shift to the color-singleton target. The eyes often landed for a very short period of time (25--150 ms) near the new object. The results suggest parallel programming of two saccades: one voluntary, goal-directed eye movement toward the color-singleton target and one stimulus-driven eye movement reflexively elicited by the appearance of the new object. Neuroanatomical structures responsible for parallel programming of saccades are discussed.},

	abstract = {Learning and adaptation in the domain of orientation processing are among the most studied topics in the literature. However, little effort has been devoted to explaining the diverse array of experimental findings via a physiologically based model. We have started to address this issue in the framework of the recurrent model of V1 orientation selectivity and found that reported changes in V1 orientation tuning curves after learning and adaptation can both be explained with the model. Specifically, the sharpening of orientation tuning curves near the trained orientation after learning can be accounted for by slightly reducing net excitatory connections to cells around the trained orientation, while the broadening and peak shift of the tuning curves after adaptation can be reproduced by appropriately scaling down both excitation and inhibition around the adapted orientation. In addition, we investigated the perceptual consequences of the tuning curve changes induced by learning and adaptation using signal detection theory. We found that in the case of learning, the physiological changes can account for the psychophysical data well. In the case of adaptation, however, there is a clear discrepancy between the psychophysical data from alert human subjects and the physiological data from anesthetized animals. Instead, human adaptation studies can be better accounted for by the learning data from behaving animals. Our work suggests that adaptation in behaving subjects may be viewed as a short-term form of learning.},

For smooth pursuit, different motor responses to the same sensory stimulus (horizontal target motion) can be learned, stored and gated in or out, according to context (vertical eye position). The dynamic properties of the 'open-loop' portion of horizontal, disparity-driven vergence eye movements are under adaptive control. Eye torsion is also subject to adaptive control, including torsional 'phoria adaptation' and cross-coupling of torsion into the horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex ({VOR}). Finally, lesions of the oculomotor vermis in monkeys produce disordered binocular ocular motor function: 'esodeviations' in the absence of disparity cues, and decreased adaptation of the horizontal phoria to a sustained disparity induced by wearing a horizontal prism in front of one eye. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Ocular responses in humans elicited by a small perturbing motion presented 300 ms after appearance of a target were used as a measure of the gain of visuomotor transmission. After the perturbation, the target was either moved horizontally (pursuit trial) or remained in a stationary position (fixation trial). The trial sequence randomly included pursuit and fixation. The amplitude of the response to the perturbation was modulated in a trial-by-trial manner based on the immediately preceding trial, with preceding fixation and pursuit trials decreasing and increasing the gain, respectively. The effect of the previous trial was larger with shorter intertrial intervals, but did not diminish for at least 2,000 ms. A time-series analysis showed that the response amplitude was significantly correlated with the past few trials, with dynamics that could be approximated by a first-order linear system. The results suggest that the {CNS} integrates recent experiences to set the gain in preparation for upcoming tracking movements in a changing environment.},

	abstract = {People generally fail to produce random sequences by overusing alternating patterns and avoiding repeating ones---the gambler's fallacy bias. We can explain the neural basis of this bias in terms of a biologically motivated neural model that learns from errors in predicting what will happen next. Through mere exposure to random sequences over time, the model naturally develops a representation that is biased toward alternation, because of its sensitivity to some surprisingly rich statistical structure that emerges in these random sequences. Furthermore, the model directly produces the best-fitting bias-gain parameter for an existing Bayesian model, by which we obtain an accurate fit to the human data in random sequence production. These results show that our seemingly irrational, biased view of randomness can be understood instead as the perfectly reasonable response of an effective learning mechanism to subtle statistical structure embedded in random sequences.},

	abstract = {We studied the effects of horizontal smooth pursuit on the ocular tracking responses to brief perturbations of a textured background in humans. When the subject was fixating a stationary spot, a brief perturbation (60 °/s, 40 ms) of the background in any one of four directions (right, left, up, down) elicited a small tracking response. When the subject was pursuing a target moving against the stationary background, the same background perturbation elicited a larger response when in the same direction as the pursuit, but a smaller response when its direction was opposite to the pursuit; the response to vertical background perturbations was also enhanced during pursuit. When the subject was pursuing while the target and background were moving together, the same background perturbations elicited the larger responses regardless of their direction. These results indicate that the sensitivity to background motion is increased during smooth pursuit. However, when pursuit is executed against a stationary background - the usual situation in everyday life - the system is selectively insensitive to the reafferent visual input associated with pursuit, thereby reducing the potentially adverse effect of the background on pursuit performance.

	abstract = {When presented with an auditory sequence, the brain acts as a predictive-coding device that extracts regularities in the transition probabilities between sounds and detects unexpected deviations from these regularities. Does such prediction require conscious vigilance, or does it continue to unfold automatically in the sleeping brain? The mismatch negativity and P300 components of the auditory event-related potential, reflecting two steps of auditory novelty detection, have been inconsistently observed in the various sleep stages. To clarify whether these steps remain during sleep, we recorded simultaneous electroencephalographic and magnetoencephalographic signals during wakefulness and during sleep in normal subjects listening to a hierarchical auditory paradigm including short-term (local) and long-term (global) regularities. The global response, reflected in the P300, vanished during sleep, in line with the hypothesis that it is a correlate of high-level conscious error detection. The local mismatch response remained across all sleep stages (N1, N2, and {REM} sleep), but with an incomplete structure; compared with wakefulness, a specific peak reflecting prediction error vanished during sleep. Those results indicate that sleep leaves initial auditory processing and passive sensory response adaptation intact, but specifically disrupts both short-term and long-term auditory predictive coding.},

Recently, a laboratory-based simulated gambling task has been used to quantify similar decision-making deficits in ventromedial frontal lobe damaged participants. We hypothesized that participants with Huntington's disease ({HD}) would show deficits on this gambling task. For this study, 14 {HD} participants were asked to make 100 selections from four decks of cards with varied payoffs in order to maximize winnings of play money. They were compared to 22 participants with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) and 33 healthy controls. After an initial period in which participants had to learn contingencies of the decks, the {HD} group made fewer advantageous selections than the {PD} and control groups. In {HD}, the number of advantageous selections in the gambling task was correlated with measures of memory and conceptualization but not disinhibition. Thus, people with {HD} may have had difficulties learning or remembering win/loss contingencies of the decks, or they may have failed to consistently take these into account in their card selections. These findings are consistent with current models of frontal-subcortical brain circuits and behavior.},

We show that humans can both perceive and pursue the motion of line-figure objects, even when partial occlusion makes the resulting image motion vastly different from the underlying object motion. Our results show that both perception and pursuit can perform largely accurate motion integration, i.e. the selective combination of local motion signals across the visual field to derive global object motion. Furthermore, because we manipulated perceived motion while keeping image motion identical, the observed parallel changes in perception and pursuit show that the motion signals driving steady-state pursuit and perception are linked. These findings disprove current pursuit models whose control strategy is to minimize retinal image motion, and suggest a new framework for the interplay between visual cortex and cerebellum in visuomotor control.},

In the third experiment, subjects successfully tracked the invisible center of a rolling wheel when all that could be seen were points of light travelling in a cycloidal path on the rim of the wheel.

Low thresholds (less than or equal to 50 {microA}) for electrically evoking saccadic eye movements were used to locate injection sites in four monkeys. Cases were grouped according to the amplitude of saccades evoked or predicted at the injection site. Dorsomedial prearcuate injection sites where large saccades were elicited were classified as {lFEF} cases, whereas ventrolateral prearcuate sites where small saccades were evoked were designated {sFEF} cases. One control case was injected in the medial postarcuate area 6. We found five descending fiber bundles from {FEF}; fibers to the striatum, which enter the caudate nucleus at or just rostral to the genu of the internal capsule; fibers to the claustrum, which travel in the external capsule; and transthalamic, subthalamic, and pedunculopontine fibers. Our results indicate that transthalamic and subthalamic pathways supply all terminal sites in the thalamus, subthalamus, and tegmentum of the midbrain and pons, whereas pedunculopontine fibers appear to terminate in the pontine and reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus exclusively. Frontal eye field terminal fields in the striatum were topographically organized: {lFEF} projections terminated dorsal and rostral to {sFEF} projections. Thus, {lFEF} terminal fields were located centrally in the head and body of the caudate nucleus and a small dorsomedial portion of the putamen, whereas {sFEF} terminal fields were located in ventrolateral parts of the caudate body and ventromedial parts of the putamen. In the claustrum, {lFEF} projections terminated dorsal and rostral to {sFEF} projections. Projections from {FEF} terminated in ventral and caudal parts of the subthalamic nucleus without a clear topography. By comparison, terminal fields from medial postarcuate area 6 were located more caudally and laterally in the striatum and claustrum than projections from {FEF}, and more centrally in the subthalamic nucleus. In the thalamus, {FEF} terminal patches in some thalamic nuclei were also topographically organized. Projections from {lFEF} terminated in dorsal area X, dorsolateral medial dorsal nucleus, pars parvicellularis ({MDpc}), and the caudal pole of {MDpc}, whereas projections from {sFEF} terminated in ventral area X, medial dorsal nucleus, pars multiformis, and caudal medial dorsal nucleus pars densocellularis.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

However, these studies left some questions unanswered: Are perception and pursuit driven by the same or independent neuronal signals within this pathway? Are the perceptual interpretation of visual motion information and the motor response to visual signals limited by the same source of neuronal noise? Here, we review psychophysical studies that were motivated by these questions and compared perception and pursuit behaviorally in healthy human observers. We further review studies that focused on the interaction between perception and pursuit. The majority of results point to similarities between perception and pursuit, but dissociations were also reported. We discuss recent developments in this research area and conclude with suggestions for common and separate principles for the guidance of perceptual and motor responses to visual motion information.},

Although it has clearly been established that cortical areas involved in processing visual motion support both perception and smooth pursuit eye movements, it remains unknown whether the same or different sets of neurons within these structures perform these two functions. Examination of the trial-by-trial variation in human perceptual and pursuit responses during a simultaneous psychophysical and oculomotor task reveals that the direction signals for pursuit and perception are not only similar on average but also co-vary on a trial-by-trial basis, even when performance is at or near chance and the decisions are determined largely by neural noise. We conclude that the neural signal encoding the direction of target motion that drives steady-state pursuit and supports concurrent perceptual judgments emanates from a shared ensemble of cortical neurons.},

In particular, the force of gravity constrains round objects to roll on the ground with a particular rotational and translational motion. We measured tracking eye movements towards rolling objects. We found that objects with rotational and translational motion that was congruent with an object rolling on the ground elicited faster tracking eye movements during pursuit initiation than incongruent stimuli. Relative to a condition without rotational component, we compared objects with this motion with a condition in which there was no rotational component, we essentially obtained benefits of congruence, and, to a lesser extent, costs from incongruence. Anticipatory pursuit responses showed no congruence effect, suggesting that the effect is based on visually-driven predictions, not on velocity storage. We suggest that the eye movement system incorporates information about object kinematics acquired by a lifetime of experience with visual stimuli obeying the laws of Newtonian physics.},

	abstract = {Many studies indicate that saccades are necessarily preceded by a shift of attention to the target location. There is no direct evidence for the same coupling during smooth pursuit. If smooth pursuit and attention were coupled, pursuit onset should be delayed whenever attention is focused on a stationary, non-target location. To test this hypothesis, observers were instructed to shift their attention to a peripheral location according to a location cue (Experiments 1 and 2) or a symbolic cue (Experiment 3) around the time of smooth pursuit initiation. Attending to static targets had only negligible effects on smooth pursuit latencies and the early open-loop response but lowered pursuit velocity substantially about the onset of closed-loop pursuit. Around this time, eye velocity reflected the competition between the to-be-tracked and to-be-attended object motion, entailing a reduction of eye velocity by 50\% compared to the single task condition. The precise time course of attentional modulation of smooth pursuit initiation was at odds with the idea that an attention shift must precede any voluntary eye movement. Finally, the initial catch-up saccades were strongly delayed with attention diverted from the pursuit target. Implications for models of target selection for pursuit and saccades are discussed.},

	abstract = {When primates reach for an object, they very often direct an eye movement toward the object as well. This pattern of directing both eye and limb movements to the same object appears to be fundamental to eye-hand coordination. We investigated interactions between saccades and reaching movements in a rhesus monkey model system. The amplitude and peak velocity of isolated eye movements are positively correlated with one another. This relationship is called the main sequence. We now report that the main sequence relationship for saccades is changed during coordinated eye and arm movements. In particular, peak eye velocity is approximately 4\% faster for the same size saccade when the saccade is accompanied by a coordinated arm movement. Saccade duration is reduced by an equivalent amount. The main sequence relationship is unperturbed when the arm moves simultaneously but in the opposite direction as the eyes, suggesting that eye and arm movements must be tightly coordinated to produce the effect. Candidate areas mediating this interaction include the posterior parietal cortex and the superior colliculus.},

	abstract = {Dopamine has long been implicated in reward-based learning and the expression of such learned associations on performance. Robust evidence supports its effects on learning and performance, but teasing these apart has proved challenging. Here we have adapted a classic test of value-based learning, the probabilistic selection task, to disentangle effects of dopamine on value-based performance from effects on value-based learning. Valence-specific effects of dopamine on this specific task cannot be accounted for by modulation of learning, and therefore must reflect modulation of performance. We found that dopaminergic medication, consisting of levodopa and/or dopamine agonists taken at own dose, in 18 patients with mild Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr  2.5) potentiated reward-based approach in terms of both accuracy and reaction times, while leaving punishment-based avoidance unaffected. These data demonstrate that the effects of dopamine on probabilistic action selection are at least partly mediated by effects on the expression of learned associations rather than on learning itself, and help refine current models of dopamine's role in reward.},

The specificity of {SEF} pathways was determined with horseradish peroxidase ({HRP}) histochemistry to compare its connections with those of the arcuate frontal eye field ({FEF}), contiguous dorsocaudal area 6 (6DC), and primary motor cortex (M1, arm/hand region). Results indicate that patterns of {SEF} connectivity were similar to the {FEF} and markedly different from areas 6DC and M1. Primary reciprocal thalamic pathways of the {SEF} were with the magnocellular ventral anterior ({VA}) nucleus, medial parvicellular {VA}, medial area X, and paralaminar medialis dorsalis (multiformis and parvicellularis). {FEF} showed similar connections but its most robust pathway was with {MD} rather than {VA}. In contrast, area 6DC showed the most extensive reciprocal connections with lateral {VApc} and lateral area X with only sparse connections with paralaminar {MD}. Area 6DC also exhibited reciprocal connections with the ventral lateral ({VL}) complex and the ventral posterior lateral nucleus, pars oralis ({VPLo}). M1 showed dense bidirectional connections with {VPLo}, and to a lesser extent, with {VL}. M1 pathways with the medial dorsal nucleus were negligible. All areas exhibited connections with the paracentral and central lateral nuclei and only M1 lacked connections with the central superior lateral nucleus. {SEF} and {FEF} exhibited similar efferent projections to the caudate and putamen. In the caudate, terminal fields were restricted to a central longitudinal core while those from area 6DC were more widely distributed. Eye field efferents were restricted to the putamen's face region while 6DC projections were more exuberant. The arm/hand region of M1 projected to the arm/hand region of the putamen.

	abstract = {We measured the detection of motion before, during and after a saccade to explore the effects of a saccade on motion perception. To isolate the low-level motion mechanism, the stimulus was a random-dot field displaced by small distance (0.3 deg) within a stationary frame. The displacement signaled motion clearly if eyes were fixated, but for the displacement during a saccade, motion was not detected whether the displacement was defined in spatial coordinates (expt 1) or in retinal coordinates (expt 2). Since motion could be seen with {ISIs} longer than the duration of a saccade (expt 3), the suppression cannot be attributed to visual loss during the saccade. Experiment 3 also showed that motion was never seen for a displacement that occurred during a saccade, even though the random dots were replaced by a uniform field during the eye movement thereby eliminating any masking effect of the sweep of the image across the retina. The purpose of the saccadic suppression of motion may be to block out unreliable motion signals that would be produced by a saccade. Since saccade distances are very often greater than the maximum distance over which the low-level motion mechanism can produce accurate direction discrimination for fine textures, motion signals would generally indicate false directions if they were not suppressed. ?? 1989.},

Using a memory-based task designed to separate these components, we show that the {SEF} contains signals coding retinal image-slip-velocity, memory, and assessment of visual motion direction, the decision of whether to pursue, and the preparation for pursuit eye movements. Bilateral muscimol injection into {SEF} resulted in directional errors in smooth pursuit, errors of whether to pursue, and impairment of initial correct eye movements. These results suggest an important role for the {SEF} in memory and assessment of visual motion direction and the programming of appropriate pursuit eye movements. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

At variancewith this notion, previous implicit learning experiments appear to have yielded dissociations between subjects' performance and beliefs. In two experiments, subjects were given an opportunity to perform an action---pressing a key on acomputer keyboard---which was associated with an outcome on the computer screen according to a free-operant contingency. The subjects in one group were asked to judge the effectiveness of the action in causing the outcome, while those in a second group were asked to maximize their points score under a payoff schedule. In the first study, the effect of varying the contingency between the action and outcome was examined by keeping the probability of an outcome contiguous with an action constant and varying the probability of an outcome in the absence of an action. Performance and judgments showed a comparable sensitivity to variations of the instrumental contingency. In the second study, the delay between the action and the resultant outcome was varied. Increasing the action-outcome delay from 0 sec up to 4 sec produced a systematic decline in both causal judgments and:perfos̃ mance relative to noncontingent, control conditions.

Methods Magnetic search coil system was used to measure horizontal and vertical eye positions. Results 'Staircase' visually guided saccades (multiple hypometric saccades separated by an intersaccadic interval) and 'staircase' square-wave jerks ({SWJ}) were present in all patients. The {SWJ} amplitude (total amplitude of the series of hypometric saccades comprising the {SWJ}) was abnormally large (mean 2 degrees ). {SWJ} frequency was also abnormally high (50-70 intrusions/min). Conclusion Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta leading to phasic excitation of the substantia nigra pars reticulata and, in turn, phasic inhibition of the superior colliculus ({SC}), may account for 'staircase' visually guided saccades in these patients. This mechanism, however, does not explain abnormally large {SWJ}, which in the traditional view results from decreased inhibition upon {SC}. The abnormally large {SWJ} could be due to a compensatory increase in frontal eye field activity secondary to the increased inhibition upon the {SC}. Abnormally large and frequent {SWJ} are often used clinically to distinguish multi-system atrophy from idiopathic {PD}. Our study, however, suggests that idiopathic {PD} cannot be excluded if the patient has large-amplitude {SWJ}.},

Suppose that the purpose of any movement is to position our body in a more rewarding state. People and other animals discount future reward as a hyperbolic function of time. Here, we show that across populations of people and monkeys there is a correlation between discounting of reward and control of movements. We consider saccadic eye movements and hypothesize that duration of a movement is equivalent to a delay of reward. The hyperbolic cost of this delay not only accounts for kinematics of saccades in adults, it also accounts for the faster saccades of children, who temporally discount reward more steeply. Our theory explains why saccade velocities increase when reward is elevated, and why disorders in the encoding of reward, for example in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, produce changes in saccade. We show that delay of reward elevates the cost of saccades, reducing velocities. Finally, we consider coordinated movements that include motion of eyes and head and find that their kinematics is also consistent with a hyperbolic, reward-dependent cost of time. Therefore, each voluntary movement carries a cost because its duration delays acquisition of reward. The cost depends on the value that the brain assigns to stimuli, and the rate at which it discounts this value in time. The motor commands that move our eyes reflect this cost of time.},

These different types of signals have to be combined for the control of eye movements. In this study we investigated how smooth pursuit eye movements integrate salience and value information. Observers were asked to track a random-dot kinematogram containing two coherent motion directions. To manipulate salience, the coherence or the density of one of the motion signals was varied. To manipulate value, observers won or lost money in a separate experiment if they were tracking one or the other motion direction. Our results show that pursuit direction was initially determined only by salience. 300-400. ms after target motion onset, pursuit steered towards the rewarded direction and the salience effects disappeared. The time course of this effect depended crucially on the difficulty to segment the two signal directions. These results indicate that salience determines early pursuit responses in the same way as saccades with short latencies. Value information is processed slower and dominates pursuit after several 100. ms.},

	abstract = {Humans shift their gaze to a new location several times per second. It is still unclear what determines where they look next. Fixation behavior is influenced by the low-level salience of the visual stimulus, such as luminance, contrast, and color, but also by high-level task demands and prior knowledge. Under natural conditions, different sources of information might conflict with each other and have to be combined. In our paradigm, we trade off visual salience against expected value. We show that both salience and value information influence the saccadic end point within an object, but with different time courses. The relative weights of salience and value are not constant but vary from eye movement to eye movement, depending critically on the availability of the value information at the time when the saccade is programmed. Short-latency saccades are determined mainly by salience, but value information is taken into account for long-latency saccades. We present a model that describes these data by dynamically weighting and integrating detailed topographic maps of visual salience and value. These results support the notion of independent neural pathways for the processing of visual information and value.},

	abstract = {Motor control is the study of how organisms make accurate goal-directed movements. Here we consider two problems that the motor system must solve in order to achieve such control. The first problem is that sensory feedback is noisy and delayed, which can make movements inaccurate and unstable. The second problem is that the relationship between a motor command and the movement it produces is variable, as the body and the environment can both change. A solution is to build adaptive internal models of the body and the world. The predictions of these internal models, called forward models because they transform motor commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both pro-duce a lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the world around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce unbiased predictions. Evidence shows that forward models remain calibrated through motor adaptation: learning driven by sensory prediction errors.},

	abstract = {Neural activity and perception are both affected by sensory history. The work presented here explores the relationship between the physiological effects of adaptation and their perceptual consequences. Perception is modeled as arising from an encoder-decoder cascade, in which the encoder is defined by the probabilistic response of a population of neurons, and the decoder transforms this population activity into a perceptual estimate. Adaptation is assumed to produce changes in the encoder, and we examine the conditions under which the decoder behavior is consistent with observed perceptual effects in terms of both bias and discriminability. We show that for all decoders, discriminability is bounded from below by the inverse Fisher information. Estimation bias, on the other hand, can arise for a variety of different reasons and can range from zero to substantial. We specifically examine biases that arise when the decoder is fixed, "unaware" of the changes in the encoding population (as opposed to "aware" of the adaptation and changing accordingly). We simulate the effects of adaptation on two well-studied sensory attributes, motion direction and contrast, assuming a gain change description of encoder adaptation. Although we cannot uniquely constrain the source of decoder bias, we find for both motion and contrast that an "unaware" decoder that maximizes the likelihood of the percept given by the preadaptation encoder leads to predictions that are consistent with behavioral data. This model implies that adaptation-induced biases arise as a result of temporary suboptimality of the decoder.},

	abstract = {Dopamine projections from the midbrain to the striatum and frontal cortex are involved in behavioral reactions controlled by rewards, as inferred from deficits in parkinsonism, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. Recent experiments have shown that dopamine neurons are not directly modulated in relation to movements. Rather, they appear to code the rewarding aspects of environmental stimuli. They show short, phasic increases of activity following primary food and liquid rewards ("unconditioned stimuli") and conditioned, reward-predicting stimuli of visual, auditory, and somatosensory modalities. They also display smaller activation-depression sequences after stimuli resembling rewards and after novel or particularly intense stimuli. Rewards are only reported as far as they occur differently than predicted. According to learning theories, a "prediction error" message may constitute a powerful teaching signal for behavior and learning. The phasic reward message is different from the more tonic enabling function of dopamine that is deficient in Parkinson's disease, indicating that dopamine neurons subserve different functions at different time scales. Neurons in other brain structures, such as the striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala, code the quality, quantity, and preference of rewards. The dopamine reward prediction error signal may cooperate with these reward perception signals during the learning and performance of behavioral reactions to motivating environmental stimuli.},

Although hoping to unravel a single dopamine function underlying these phenomena, electrophysiological and neurochemical studies still give a confusing, mutually exclusive, and partly contradictory account of dopamine's role in behavior. However, the speed of observed phasic dopamine changes varies several thousand fold, which offers a means to differentiate the behavioral relationships according to their time courses. Thus dopamine is involved in mediating the reactivity of the organism to the environment at different time scales, from fast impulse responses related to reward via slower changes with uncertainty, punishment, and possibly movement to the tonic enabling of postsynaptic motor, cognitive, and motivational systems deficient in Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {The effects of lesions, receptor blocking, electrical self-stimulation, and drugs of abuse suggest that midbrain dopamine systems are involved in processing reward information and learning approach behavior. Most dopamine neurons show phasic activations after primary liquid and food rewards and conditioned, reward-predicting visual and auditory stimuli. They show biphasic, activation-depression responses after stimuli that resemble reward-predicting stimuli or are novel or particularly salient. However, only few phasic activations follow aversive stimuli. Thus dopamine neurons label environmental stimuli with appetitive value, predict and detect rewards and signal alerting and motivating events. By failing to discriminate between different rewards, dopamine neurons appear to emit an alerting message about the surprising presence or absence of rewards. All responses to rewards and reward-predicting stimuli depend on event predictability. Dopamine neurons are activated by rewarding events that are better than predicted, remain uninfluenced by events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events that are worse than predicted. By signaling rewards according to a prediction error, dopamine responses have the formal characteristics of a teaching signal postulated by reinforcement learning theories. Dopamine responses transfer during learning from primary rewards to reward-predicting stimuli. This may contribute to neuronal mechanisms underlying the retrograde action of rewards, one of the main puzzles in reinforcement learning. The impulse response releases a short pulse of dopamine onto many dendrites, thus broadcasting a rather global reinforcement signal to postsynaptic neurons. This signal may improve approach behavior by providing advance reward information before the behavior occurs, and may contribute to learning by modifying synaptic transmission. The dopamine reward signal is supplemented by activity in neurons in striatum, frontal cortex, and amygdala, which process specific reward information but do not emit a global reward prediction error signal. A cooperation between the different reward signals may assure the use of specific rewards for selectively reinforcing behaviors. Among the other projection systems, noradrenaline neurons predominantly serve attentional mechanisms and nucleus basalis neurons code rewards heterogeneously. Cerebellar climbing fibers signal errors in motor performance or errors in the prediction of aversive events to cerebellar Purkinje cells. Most deficits following dopamine-depleting lesions are not easily explained by a defective reward signal but may reflect the absence of a general enabling function of tonic levels of extracellular dopamine. Thus dopamine systems may have two functions, the phasic transmission of reward information and the tonic enabling of postsynaptic neurons.},

The use of a changeover delay between crossover eye movements and reinforcement had the effect of changing the pattern of scanning from fixating four dials in succession or in a Z-shaped pattern to scanning vertically the dials on either side with fewer crossovers. In the presence of a changeover delay, subjects matched relative eye-movement rates and relative reinforcement rates on each schedule. Rate of crossover eye movements, with a changeover delay in effect, was also inversely related to the difference in reinforcements arranged by the concurrent schedules. The results suggest that for stimuli whose critical components are arranged spatially, conditioned eye movements play an important part in selective stimulus control.},

	abstract = {The ability to learn stimulus-reward associations on the basis of reward prediction errors critically depends on the mesolimbic dopaminergic system including the dopaminergic midbrain and the ventral striatum. It is known that healthy elderly and patients with Parkinson's disease are less proficient than healthy young adults in learning stimulus-reward contingencies, but it is unclear whether this is due to dysfunctional mesolimbic reward prediction or due to deficiency in processing the rewards per se. We used a well-established event-related {fMRI} reward-prediction paradigm to address this question. Young adults showed the well-replicated pattern of midbrain and ventral striatal activation for stimuli that predicted monetary reward when compared with stimuli that predicted neutral feedback. Also, as expected, the predicted reward feedback itself did not elicit a mesolimbic response. Healthy elderly subjects and unmedicated early-stage idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients showed the opposite pattern with an absent mesolimbic reward prediction response, but mesolimbic activation to the reward feedback itself. This suggests that the healthy elderly and Parkinson's disease patients were less proficient in learning the predictive value of the reward cues despite preserved mesolimbic processing of reward prediction errors. Parkinson's disease patients additionally displayed a relatively increased response of the anterior cingulate during reward feedback processing and diminished functional connectivity of the midbrain and ventral striatum. Our results are compatible with existing behavioural evidence that both groups exhibit a particularly pronounced deficit in learning from positive feedback and support the view that a tendency to underestimate expected values of reward cues might underlie this deficit. Furthermore, alterations in reward processing in Parkinson's disease extend beyond accelerated ageing effects and include altered connectivity within the mesolimbic system.},

Natural cues, however, rarely convey information with perfect 24 certainty, and responses to uncertainty provide insights about how predictive behaviors are 25 generated. Subjects smoothly pursued targets that moved to the right or left with varying cued 26 probabilities. {ASEM} strength in a given direction increased with the probability level. The type 27 of cue also played a role. {ASEM} elicited by symbolic visual cues tended to underweight low 28 probabilities and overweight high probabilities. Cues based on memory (varying the proportion 29 of trials with left or right motion) produced the opposite pattern, overweighting low probabilities 30 and underweighting high probabilities. Finally, cues whose perceptual structure depicted the 31 motion path produced a bias in {ASEM} in the depicted direction that was maintained across levels 32 of cue congruency. The results show that the smooth pursuit system relies on a combination of 33 signals, including memory for recent target motions, interpretation of cues, and prior beliefs 34 about the relationship between the perceptual configuration and the motion path to determine the 35 anticipatory response in the presence of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {To determine the organization of visual inputs and outputs of the striatum, we placed multiple retrograde and anterograde tracers into physiologically identified portions of the striatum known to receive inputs from visual cortex in seven macaques. The injection sites included the tail and genu of the caudate nucleus (14 cases), the head of the caudate (1 case), and the ventral putamen (3 cases). Retrogradely labeled cells were located predominantly in layer 5 of the ipsilateral cortex but were also found in layers 3 and 6. After caudate injections, labeled cells were found both in large, nearly continuous regions of cortex topographically related to the site of the injection, and in several smaller cortical regions that were discontinuous and common to many or all of the injection sites. The continuously labeled regions included nearly all known visual cortical areas, except for the striate cortex. After injections in the rostral tail, the continuously labeled region included the rostral portion of Bonin and Bailey's (Urbana: University of Illinois Press. '47) area {TE} and adjacent portions of {TF}, {TH}, {TG}, and, occasionally, area 35 (Brodmann, Leipzig: J.A. Barth. '09). After injections into the posterior tail and ventral genu, the labeled region shifted posteriorly in {TE} and {TF}, and into {TEO} and the ventral parts of prestriate areas V4, V3, and (sparsely) V2. As the injection site was advanced into the dorsal genu, the labeled region shifted dorsally toward the parietal lobe, including prestriate areas {MT} and {PO}, parietal area {PG} (Brodmann's area 7), the ventral and lateral intraparietal sulcal areas ({VIP} and {LIP}, respectively), and area {PE} and adjacent area {LC} (Brodmann's areas 5 and 23, respectively). The discontinuous areas labeled by many different injections included the principal sulcus/frontal eye field region, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the superior temporal polysensory area. Thus, whereas temporal, occipital, and parietal visual cortical areas project into the caudate largely according to proximity, certain multimodal cortical areas seem to have a much wider projection. To determine whether visual cortical areas have additional projections to the caudate beyond the territory of our retrograde injection sites in the tail and genu. 3H-labeled amino acids were injected into areas {TE}, V4, and {MT} in three additional monkeys. The topographic location of label in the tail and genu of the caudate in these cases was consistent with the results from injections of retrograde tracers into the caudate.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, neurons hypothesized to play a role in reinforcement learning. Although previous studies have shown that Parkinson's patients are impaired in tasks involving learning from feedback, they have not directly tested the widely held hypothesis that dopamine neuron activity specifically encodes the reward prediction error signal used in reinforcement learning models. To test a key prediction of this hypothesis, we fit choice behavior from a dynamic foraging task with reinforcement learning models and show that treatment with dopaminergic drugs alters choice behavior in a manner consistent with the theory. More specifically, we found that dopaminergic drugs selectively modulate learning from positive outcomes. We observed no effect of dopaminergic drugs on learning from negative outcomes. We also found a novel dopamine-dependent effect on decision making that is not accounted for by reinforcement learning models: perseveration in choice, independent of reward history, increases with Parkinson's disease and decreases with dopamine therapy.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiological experiments in primates, alongside neuropsychological and functional magnetic resonance investigations in humans, have significantly enhanced our understanding of the neural architecture of decision making. In this review, I consider the more limited database of experiments that have investigated how dopamine and serotonin activity influences the choices of human adults. These include those experiments that have involved the administration of drugs to healthy controls, experiments that have tested genotypic influences upon dopamine and serotonin function, and, finally, some of those experiments that have examined the effects of drugs on the decision making of clinical samples. Pharmacological experiments in humans are few in number and face considerable methodological challenges in terms of drug specificity, uncertainties about pre- vs post-synaptic modes of action, and interactions with baseline cognitive performance. However, the available data are broadly consistent with current computational models of dopamine function in decision making and highlight the dissociable roles of dopamine receptor systems in the learning about outcomes that underpins value-based decision making. Moreover, genotypic influences on (interacting) prefrontal and striatal dopamine activity are associated with changes in choice behavior that might be relevant to understanding exploratory behaviors and vulnerability to addictive disorders. Manipulations of serotonin in laboratory tests of decision making in human participants have provided less consistent results, but the information gathered to date indicates a role for serotonin in learning about bad decision outcomes, non-normative aspects of risk-seeking behavior, and social choices involving affiliation and notions of fairness. Finally, I suggest that the role played by serotonin in the regulation of cognitive biases, and representation of context in learning, point toward a role in the cortically mediated cognitive appraisal of reinforcers when selecting between actions, potentially accounting for its influence upon the processing salient aversive outcomes and social choice.},

	abstract = {Dodge (1903) gave the first comprehensive description of the types of eye movement which can occur. Since that time there has been repeated confirmation that when the eyes follow moving objects they make two types of movement: jerky movements, called saccadic movements, and smooth movements in the intervals between these. Westheimer (1954a, b) has analysed the saccadic movements and shown them to be the response to simultaneous rapid changes in innervation to the eye muscles involved. The nature of the movement is determined largely by the mechanical properties of the structures in the orbit. The smooth movements have been described by several workers. Dodge, Travis \& Fox (1930) investigated the movements obtained when tracking black and white vertical bars moving horizontally across the visual field-opto-kinetic nystagmus-in man, and also the response to a \&apos;slit\&apos; of light moving from side to side with simple harmonic motion; Rademaker \& Ter Braak (1948) described opto-kinetic nystagmus in rabbits; West- heimer (1954b) investigated the response to the horizontal movement of a single spot of light with uniform velocity, harmonic motion, random motion, and with uniform velocity exposed intermittently. There are three questions which have not been satisfactorily answered by these investigations on tracking movements. First, what decides whether the eyes should perform a saccadic movement or a smooth move- ment? Secondly, in what way are smooth movements metrically related to the movement of the target? Thirdly, are saccadic movements and smooth tracking movements different modes of action of the same neuro- logical apparatus, or are different pathways involved? What decides whether the eyes should perform a saccadic movement or a smooth movement? There is abundant evidence that when the target is stationary and does not lie in the line of sight, fixation is achieved by one or more saccadic movements. Smooth movements are only elicited when the image of the target moves smoothly over the retina. The association between the movement of the image over the retina and smooth tracking eye movements has led to the assertion (e.g. Walsh, 1957) that the move- ment of the image is the stimulus which evokes smooth tracking, although the evidence is insufficient to justify this conclusion. The evidence available is equally compatible with the view that both saccadic and smooth move- ments are caused by positional errors in fixation, but that smooth move- ments occur only when there is no discontinuity in the position of the target. Evidence will be presented here that it is indeed the movement of the image over the retina which is detected and measured, and results in a smooth tracking response. In what way are smooth eye movements metrically related to the move- ment of the target? Dodge et al. (1930) have shown that the maximum speed of movement of the target which can be adequately tracked is about 30-40\${\textbackslash},{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$/sec. This has been confirmed by Westheimer. However, no detailed observations have been reported which relate the way in which the final tracking speed is reached from an initial state of rest, to the speed of the target. It will be shown here that the speed of the target determines the rate at which the final tracking speed is reached. Such observations are of importance because they throw light on the way in which information about how the target moves is utilized to produce an appropriate response. Are saccadic movements and smooth tracking movements different modes of action of the same neurological apparatus, or not? The pathways involved in fixation and tracking have not been successfully identified. It is not clear whether the cortex is necessarily involved in these movements. Stimulation and ablation experiments reported in the literature have given confficting results, and the nature of the movements is rarely reported. The possibility exists that some information can be gleaned from the way drugs influence tracking responses. It will be shown that saccadic and smooth movements may be differentially affected by drugs. This paper presents a re-examination of the eye-movement responses to horizontally moving targets, with particular emphasis on these three questions.},

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: During value-based decision-making, individuals consider the various options and select the one that provides the maximum subjective value. Although the brain integrates abstract information to compute and compare these values, the only behavioral outcome is often the decision itself. However, if the options are visual stimuli, during deliberation the brain moves the eyes from one stimulus to the other. Previous work suggests that saccade vigor, i.e., peak velocity as a function of amplitude, is greater if reward is associated with the visual stimulus. This raises the possibility that vigor during the free viewing of options may be influenced by the valuation of each option. Here, humans chose between a small, immediate monetary reward and a larger but delayed reward. As the deliberation began, vigor was similar for the saccades made to the two options but diverged 0.5 s before decision time, becoming greater for the preferred option. This difference in vigor increased as a function of the difference in the subjective values that the participant assigned to the delayed and immediate options. After the decision was made, participants continued to gaze at the options, but with reduced vigor, making it possible to infer timing of the decision from the sudden drop in vigor. Therefore, the subjective value that the brain assigned to a stimulus during decision-making affected the motor system via the vigor with which the eyes moved toward that stimulus. {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}: We find that, as individuals deliberate between two rewarding options and arrive at a decision, the vigor with which they make saccades to each option reflects a real-time evaluation of that option. With deliberation, saccade vigor diverges between the two options, becoming greater for the option that the individual will eventually choose. The results suggest a shared element between the network that assigns value to a stimulus during the process of decision-making and the network that controls vigor of movements toward that stimulus.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia have been associated with processes of reinforcement learning. A strong line of supporting evidence comes from the recording of dopamine ({DA}) neurones in behaving monkeys. Unpredicted, biologically salient events, including rewards cause a stereotypic short-latency (70-100 ms), short-duration (100-200 ms) burst of {DA} activity - the phasic response. This response is widely considered to represent reward prediction errors used as teaching signals in appetitive learning to promote actions that will maximise future reward acquisition. For {DA} signalling to perform this function, sensory processing afferent to {DA} neurones should discriminate unpredicted reward-related events. However, the comparative response latencies of {DA} neurones and orienting gaze-shifts indicate that phasic {DA} responses are triggered by pre-attentive sensory processing. Consequently, in circumstances where biologically salient events are both spatially and temporally unpredictable, it is unlikely their identity will be known at the time of {DA} signalling. The limited quality of afferent sensory processing and the precise timing of phasic {DA} signals, suggests that they may play a less direct role in 'Law of Effect' appetitive learning. Rather, the 'time-stamp' nature of the phasic response, in conjunction with the other signals likely to be present in the basal ganglia at the time of phasic {DA} input, suggests it may reinforce the discovery of unpredicted sensory events for which the organism is responsible. Furthermore, {DA}-promoted repetition of preceding actions/movements should enable the system to converge on those aspects of context and behavioural output that lead to the discovery of novel actions. © 2007.},

	abstract = {The parietal cortex is a critical interface for attention and integration of multiple sensory signals that can be used for the implementation of motor plans. Many neurons in this region exhibit strong attention-, reach-, grasp- or saccade-related activity. Here, we review human lesion studies supporting the critical role of the parietal cortex in saccade planning. Studies of patients with unilateral parietal damage and spatial neglect reveal characteristic spatially lateralized deficits of saccade programming when multiple stimuli compete for attention. However, these patients also show bilateral impairments of saccade initiation and control that are difficult to explain in the context of their lateralized deficits of visual attention. These findings are reminiscent of the deficits of oculomotor control observed in patients with Bálint's syndrome consecutive to bilateral parietal damage. We propose that some oculomotor deficits following parietal damage are compatible with a decisive role of the parietal cortex in saccade planning under conditions of sensory competition, while other deficits reflect disinhibition of low-level structures of the oculomotor network in the absence of top-down parietal modulation.},

	abstract = {A recent paper (Zald \& Andreotti, 2010) reviewed neuropsychological tasks that assess the function of the orbital and ventromedial portions of the prefrontal cortex ({OMPFC}). Neuropathological studies have shown that the function of the {OMPFC} should be preserved in the early stages of Parkinson's disease ({PD}) but becomes affected in the advanced stages of {PD}. This pattern has also been suggested by studies that have shown that dopaminergic drugs impair the performance of early {PD} patients in {OMPFC} tasks that involve reinforcement learning but enhance the performance of advanced {PD} patients. Based on these empirical findings, we reviewed the neuropsychological evidence of {OMPFC} functions in {PD} patients to test two hypotheses regarding the following: (1) {OMPFC} functions at different stages of {PD}; (2) different effects of dopaminergic drugs on {OMPFC} functions based on {PD} stage and task demand. We focused our review only on the neuropsychological tasks that were specific and sensitive to the functions of the {OMPFC} and that were adopted at different stages of {PD}, such as reversal learning tasks, the Iowa Gambling Task and the affective Theory of Mind task. We found robust empirical evidence that in early {PD}, {OMPFC} functions are preserved and dopaminergic drugs result in a detrimental effect when the task involves reinforcement learning. Further studies are needed to verify the status of {OMPFC} functions in non-demented, advanced {PD} and to describe the longitudinal course of {OMPFC} functions in this clinical population. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Cognitive impairments are common in patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) from the early stages. Recent studies reported that medicated {PD} patients have poor performances, with respect to age-matched healthy controls, in a decision-making task like the Iowa Gambling Task ({IGT}), which detects the ability to alter choice behavior in response to fluctuations in reward contingencies. The {IGT} principally activates functions related to the orbitofrontal cortex, which plays a crucial role in the generation of outcome expectancies and processing of rewards. The analysis of {IGT} performances of {PD} patients is of particular interest because {PD} represents a good clinical model to study reward processing when its neural bases are affected by a neuropathology or are overdosed by dopaminergic therapies. As a matter of fact, either {PD}-related neuropathology in advanced stages of the disease or the dopamine replacement therapy from earlier stages of {PD} may affect the functioning of the orbitofrontal cortex. Three causal hypotheses on a dysfunctional decision making in {PD} patients, as assessed by {IGT}, are discussed. Finally, the possible relation between the phenomenon of decision-making impairment and impulse control disorders, a psychiatric complication observed with increasing frequency in {PD} patients, is discussed.},

	abstract = {Humans cannot typically produce smooth eye movements in the absence of a moving stimulus. However, they can produce predictive smooth eye movements if they expect a target of a known velocity to reappear. Here, we observed that participants could extract velocity information from two simultaneously presented moving targets in order to produce a subsequent predictive smooth eye movement for one of the two targets. Subjects fixated a stationary cross during the presentation of two targets, moving rightward at different velocities. In the next presentation, a single target was presented, which participants tracked with their eyes. A static cue, presented 700 ms before the moving target, indicated which of the two targets would be presented. Predictive eye movements were of an appropriate velocity, even when participants did not know in advance which of the two targets would subsequently be cued. However, the scaling of predictive eye velocity was marginally less accurate in this divided attention condition than when participants knew the identity of the cued target in advance, or a single target was presented during fixation. In a second experiment, we found that the velocity cued on the previous trial had a greater effect than the uncued velocity on the current trial. The negligible effect of the uncued velocity indicates that participants were extremely effective at selectively reproducing one of two recently viewed velocities. However, other influences, such as past history, also affected predictive smooth eye movements. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It is as yet unclear whether this distinction holds for predictable as well as unpredictable outcomes. Using {ERPs}, the present study aimed to determine whether predictable and unpredictable outcomes are coded differently in the brain. Participants had to choose between one of two options: the certain option was always associated with a gain of 10€, while the uncertain option entailed a gain of 30€ or a loss of 10€, with a probability of 50\% each. Overall, subjects showed a clear preference for the certain option, a tendency which became more pronounced during the course of the experiment. An early {ERP} component, the P200, reflected the predictability of outcomes, which was critical for the subsequent decisions. The later feedback related negativity ({FRN}) reflected the known distinction between gains and losses, while the N500 again reflected differential processing of predictable and unpredictable outcomes. Neither {FRN} nor the N500 were significantly related to behaviour. Predictability appears to play a central role in outcome evaluation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We compared the neuronal discharge of these cerebellar regions using a memory-based, smooth-pursuit task that distinguishes discharge related to movement preparation and execution from the discharge related to the processing of visual motion signals or their memory. Monkeys were required to pursue (i.e., go), or not pursue (i.e., no-go) in a cued direction, based on the memory of visual motion direction and go/no-go instructions. Most (60 \%) of task-related vermal Purkinje cells (P-cells) and {cFN} neurons discharged specifically during the memory period following no-go instructions; their discharge was correlated with memory of no-go instructions but was unrelated to eye movements per se during the action period of go trials. The latencies of no-go discharge of vermal P-cells and {cFN} neurons were similar, but were significantly longer than those of supplementary eye field ({SEF}) no-go neurons during an identical task. Movement-preparation signals were found in ̃30 \% of smooth-pursuit-related neurons in these cerebellar regions and some of them also carried visual memory signals. Our results suggest that no-go neurons are a newly revealed class of neurons, detected using the memory-based pursuit task, in the oculomotor vermis-{cFN} pathway and that this pathway contributes specifically to planning requiring the working memory of no-go instructions and preparation of tracking eye movements.},

	abstract = {1. We recorded the simple spike firing rate of gaze velocity Purkinje cells ({GVP}-cells) in the flocculus/ventral paraflocculus of two monkeys during the smooth pursuit eye movements evoked by a target that was initially at rest, started suddenly, moved at a constant velocity, and then stopped. 2. For target motion in the preferred direction, {GVP}-cells showed a large transient increase in firing rate at the onset of pursuit, a smaller but sustained increase during the maintenance of pursuit, and a smooth return to baseline firing with little undershoot at the offset of pursuit. For target motion in the nonpreferred direction, {GVP}-cells showed a small decrease in firing rate at the onset of pursuit, a similar sustained decrease during the maintenance of pursuit, but a large transient increase in firing rate at the offset of pursuit before returning to baseline firing. 3. We pooled the data in our sample of horizontal {GVP}-cells by subtracting the population average of firing rate recorded during pursuit in the nonpreferred direction from the population average recorded during pursuit in the preferred direction. We transformed this net population average by passing it through a model of the brain stem final common pathway and the oculomotor plant. This yielded a signal that closely matched the observed trajectory of eye velocity during pursuit. We conclude that the transient overshoots exhibited in the firing rate of {GVP}-cells can provide appropriate compensation for the lagging dynamics of the oculomotor plant.},

	abstract = {Information about the future trajectory of a visual target is contained not only in the history of target motion but also in static visual cues, e.g., the street provides information about the car's future trajectory. For most natural moving targets, this information imposes strong constraints on the relation between velocity and acceleration which can be exploited by predictive smooth pursuit mechanisms. We questioned how cue-induced predictive changes in pursuit direction depend on target speed and how cue- and target-induced pursuit interact. Subjects pursued a target entering a +/-90 degrees curve and moving on either a homogeneous background or on a low contrast static band indicating the future trajectory. The cue induced a predictive change of pursuit direction, which occurred before curve onset of the target. The predictive velocity component orthogonal to the initial pursuit direction started later and became faster with increasing target velocity. The predictive eye acceleration increased quadratically with target velocity and was independent of the initial target direction. After curve onset, cue- and target-induced pursuit velocity components were not linearly superimposed. The quadratic increase of eye acceleration with target velocity is consistent with the natural velocity scaling implied by the two-thirds power law, which is a characteristic of biological controlled movements. Comparison with linear pursuit models reveals that the ratio between eye acceleration and actual or expected retinal slip cannot be considered a constant gain factor. To obey a natural velocity scaling, this acceleration gain must linearly increase with target or pursuit velocity. We suggest that gain control mechanisms, which affect target-induced changes of pursuit velocity, act similarly on predictive changes of pursuit induced by static visual cues.},

At a specified location the target either: (1) suddenly vanished; or (2) jumped to the fovea with target retinal velocity and feedback becoming 0 (target stabilized at the fovea). In each type of trial, the subjects either: "looked" at the target, "pushed" the target, or "passively" gazed. When the target vanished, eye velocity decreased exponentially with a short time-constant (tau approximately 0.10 sec), regardless of whether the subjects were "looking," "pushing" or "passively" gazing. However, some subjects while "pushing" (using an imaginary target) did generate low velocity smooth movement (1-2.5 deg/sec) late in the offset. When the target was stabilized at the fovea, eye velocity also decreased, but with a relatively long time-constant (tau = 0.4-0.8 sec). The time-constant was the same with both "looking," and "pushing", but was shorter for some subjects with "passive" gazing (tau = 0.1-0.5 sec). These findings show that smooth pursuit offset is influenced by the presence of a target, but is relatively independent of attentional mode. All of the pursuit offset responses can be simulated using a model of the pursuit system with target velocity and position inputs, and an internal positive feedback loop enabled by target presence.},

Recent studies reported that medicated patients with {PD} have poor performances compared with age-matched healthy controls in decision making tasks, specially in the Iowa Gambling Task. Two principal causal hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon: the overdosing effects of dopaminergic therapy on the orbital frontostriatal circuit that is involved in reward processing, or an amygdala dysfunction, as suggested by similar Skin Conductance Responses of patients with {PD} and amygdala-damaged patients while performing this task. The assessment of decision making with the Iowa Gambling Task was conducted in 30 nondemented and nondepressed patients with de novo {PD} and in 25 age-matched healthy controls. No statistically significant difference emerged between performances of de novo {PD} patients and performances of healthy controls. De novo {PD} patients have performances in the Iowa Gambling Task similar to those of age-matched healthy controls, suggesting that difficulties in decision making emerge, at least in de novo {PD} patients, by dopaminergic overstimulation of the orbital frontostriatal circuits.},

	abstract = {Acquisition of a new skill is generally associated with a decrease in the need for effortful control over performance, leading to the development of automaticity. Automaticity by definition has been achieved when performance of a primary task is minimally affected by other ongoing tasks. The neural basis of automaticity was examined by testing subjects in a serial reaction time ({SRT}) task under both single-task and dual-task conditions. The diminishing cost of dual-task performance was used as an index for automaticity. Subjects performed the {SRT} task during two functional magnetic imaging sessions separated by 3 h of behavioral training over multiple days. Behavioral data showed that, by the end of testing, subjects had automated performance of the {SRT} task. Before behavioral training, performance of the {SRT} task concurrently with the secondary task elicited activation in a wide network of frontal and striatal regions, as well as parietal lobe. After extensive behavioral training, dual-task performance showed comparatively less activity in bilateral ventral premotor regions, right middle frontal gyrus, and right caudate body; activity in other prefrontal and striatal regions decreased equally for single-task and dual-task conditions. These data suggest that lateral and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and their corresponding striatal targets, subserve the executive processes involved in novice dual-task performance. The results also showed that supplementary motor area and putamen/globus pallidus regions showed training-related decreases for sequence conditions but not for random condi-tions, confirming the role of these regions in the representation of learned motor sequences.},

In older adults, amplitudes of the {ERN}/Ne and the {CRN} were dissociated only in the high feedback validity condition and the {FRN} did not differ between positive and negative feedback.

Performance on a probabilistic classification learning ({PCL}) task was impaired by striatal damage (eg, in {PD} or Huntington disease) but not by circumscribed frontal lobe damage. On the other hand, performance on the Iowa Gambling Task ({IGT}) was impaired by damage to the prefrontal cortex. {METHOD} {AND} {RESULTS}: On the {PCL}, the learning of the control (age- and education-matched) group (n = 19) and the early {PD} group (n = 16) was comparable with each other, and both groups showed better performance than the later {PD} group (n = 16). On the {IGT}, the control group learned better than both of the {PD} groups. The control and early {PD} groups were similar on measures from the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Stroop Test, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Beck Depression Inventory {II}. {CONCLUSIONS}: The {PCL} and {IGT} tasks appear to rely on different parts of the frontostriatal circuitry in patients with early {PD}. The current finding that {IGT} performance was impaired in early {PD} implies ventromedial prefrontal cortical dysfunction early in the disease.},

	abstract = {Expectations about future motions can influence both perceptual judgements and pursuit eye movements. However, it is not known whether these two effects are due to shared processing, or to separate mechanisms with similar properties. We have addressed this question by providing subjects with prior information about the likely direction of motion in an upcoming random-dot motion display and measuring both the perceptual judgements and pursuit eye movements elicited by the stimulus. We quantified the subjects' responses by computing oculometric curves from their pursuit eye movements and psychometric curves from their perceptual decisions. Our results show that directional cues caused similar shifts in both the oculometric and psychometric curves toward the expected motion direction, with little change in the shapes of the curves. Prior information therefore biased the outcome of both eye movement and perceptual decisions without systematically changing their thresholds. We also found that eye movement and perceptual decisions tended to be the same on a trial-by-trial basis, at a higher frequency than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, the effects of prior information were evident during pursuit initiation, as well as during pursuit maintenance, indicating that prior information likely influenced the early processing of visual motion. We conclude that, in our experiments, expectations caused similar effects on both pursuit and perception by altering the activity of visual motion detectors that are read out by both the oculomotor and perceptual systems. Applying cognitive factors such as expectations at relatively early stages of visual processing could act to coordinate the metrics of eye movements with perceptual judgements.},

The model is a negative-feedback system that uses three parallel visual motion pathways to drive pursuit. The three visual pathways process image motion, defined as target motion with respect to the moving eye, and provide signals related to image velocity, image acceleration, and a transient that occurs at the onset of target motion. The three visual motion signals are summed and integrated to produce the eye velocity output of the model. The model reproduces the average eye velocity evoked by steps of target velocity in monkeys and humans and accounts for the variation among individual responses and subjects. When its motor pathways are expanded to include positive feedback of eye velocity and a “switch”, the model reproduces the exponential decay in eye velocity observed when a moving target stops. Manipulation of this expanded model can mimic the effects of stimulation and lesions in the arcuate pursuit area, the middle temporal visual area ({MT}), and the medial superior temporal visual area ({MST}).},

	abstract = {1. We compared the visuomotor processing underlying the onset and offset of pursuit by recording the eye movements of three monkeys as they smoothly tracked a target that was initially at rest, started to move suddenly at a constant velocity along the horizontal meridian, and then stopped. We presented this sequence of target motions in two different contexts. In the first context the target sometimes stopped after 500 ms, but on other interleaved trials the target either continued moving at a constant velocity, slowed down, speeded up, or reversed direction. In the second context the target always stopped, but the duration of the preceding constant velocity was randomized from 500 to 700 ms. 2. The dynamics of the eye velocity during the offset of pursuit were markedly different in the two experiments. When the target stopped only sometimes, the decrease in eye velocity at the offset of pursuit often overshot zero, producing a brief, small reversal in the direction of pursuit before eye speed settled to zero. When the target always stopped, the decrease in eye velocity at the offset of pursuit followed a more gradual transition toward zero with no overshoot. Thus the eye velocity profiles obtained in the first experiment contradict, whereas those obtained in the second experiment confirm, previous characterizations of the offset of pursuit as an exponential decay toward zero eye speed. 3. To investigate the basis of the different eye velocity profiles obtained in the two experiments, we probed the state of transmission along the visuomotor pathways for pursuit with the use of small perturbations in the motion of the target. We used perturbations consisting of 1 degree step changes in target position superimposed on the constant velocity motion of the target, on the basis of previous findings that such perturbations elicit saccades during fixation but smooth changes in eye speed during maintained pursuit. Single perturbations were imposed at regularly spaced intervals on separate interleaved trials during the onset, maintenance, and offset of pursuit. 4. Perturbations imposed during the onset and maintenance of pursuit had similar effects regardless of whether the target stopped only sometimes or always. In both experiments, perturbations that stepped the target in the direction opposite to the constant velocity of the target produced decreases in eye speed; perturbations in the same direction produced negligible or inconsistent changes in eye speed. The changes in eye speed caused by perturbations were largest for those perturbations introduced within the first 100 ms after the start of target motion, before the onset of the smooth eye movement, and became progressively smaller as target motion continued. The largest changes in eye speed were therefore caused by those perturbations imposed during periods of large retinal slip and by those perturbations whose direction opposed that slip. 5. Perturbations imposed during the offset of pursuit had different effects depending on whether the target stopped only sometimes or always. When the target stopped only sometimes, forward perturbations produced large increases in eye speed, whereas backward perturbations produced negligible or inconsistent changes in eye speed. Thus the visuomotor processing underlying the offset of pursuit in this experiment strongly resembled that underlying the onset of pursuit: in both cases, those perturbations in the direction opposing large retinal slip produced the largest effects. In contrast, when the target always stopped, neither forward nor backward perturbations imposed during the offset of pursuit produced large changes in eye speed. This indicates that the visuomotor processing underlying the offset of pursuit in this experiment was different from the processing underlying the onset of pursuit. 6. Perturbations also produced changes in the frequency of saccades, although these effects were less consistent than the changes in pursuit eye speed},

The saccadic system, used to explore the visual environment through fast and accurate shifts of the eyes (saccades), is a valuable model for studying adaptation mechanisms. Significant progresses have been recently made in identifying the properties and neural substrates of saccadic adaptation elicited by the double-step target paradigm. Behavioural data collected in healthy and brain-damaged subjects, and neurophysiological data from non human primates, will be reviewed in an attempt to build a coherent picture of saccadic adaptation mechanisms. Emphasis will further be put on the contextual factors of saccadic adaptation, and on the link between adaptive changes of oculomotor commands and visual perception. It will be shown that saccadic adaptation relies on multiple mechanisms according to experimental contexts, time-scales, saccade categories, and direction of adaptive changes of saccade amplitude (shortening versus lengthening). Taking into account this complexity will be a key toward a comprehensive understanding of the physiopathology of saccadic adaptation and toward the development of possible rehabilitation procedures. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Striate and extrastriate neurons present short-term synaptic depression and facilitation in response to brief stimulations. Recent psychophysical studies have shed light on some possible relationships between these short-term forms of neural plasticity and of psychophysical behavior. It has been shown that a brief adaptation to directional motion biases the perceived direction of a subsequently presented ambiguous test pattern towards the same direction to that of the adaptation (rapid visual motion priming - {rVMP}), but only after brief (40. ms) adaptation-test blank intervals. Although when the adaptation duration is increased, the perceived motion direction of the ambiguous test pattern is biased towards the opposite direction to that of the adaptation pattern (rapid motion aftereffect - {rMAE}). In the present study we stimulated {MT} and {MST} neurons via the presentation of contracting and expanding circular gratings. Our aim was to assess whether rapid effects exist at these higher levels of processing where neurons respond to optic flow, and if such effects are present determine their timescale. Results revealed strong {rMAEs} and perceptual sensitization ({PS}), which is a long-lasting facilitation that increases gradually when using intermediate and long adaptation-test blank intervals. We did not observe any effect of {rVMP}. Our results are considered to reflect the competition between coexistent forms of short- and long-term synaptic depression and facilitation implemented at different visual cortical circuitries. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Our objective was to further characterize the relationship between limbic and cognitive dysfunction in a representative sample of nondemented {PD} patients without antecedents of {ICD}, as assessed by a risk-taking test of decision-making and a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. Prospective, controlled study of 35 nondemented {PD} patients and 31 matched controls who received the Iowa gambling task ({IGT}), the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale ({MDRS}) and verbal fluencies for global cognitive function, the Stroop and digit span tests for executive function, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test for memory. Compared to controls, {PD} patients performed significantly worse on the {IGT}. No clear relationship with demographic variables including dopaminergic treatment and motor response to levodopa (stable or fluctuating) emerged. Performance on the {IGT} was not related to executive function. In contrast, an inverse relationship was found between the {IGT} and memory and global cognitive performance, with patients with the better {MDRS} and memory scores performing significantly worse on the {IGT}. Our results confirm subclinical dysfunction of the limbic system in nondemented {PD} patients.

	abstract = {Saccadic endpoint variability is often viewed as the outcome of neural noise occurring during sensorimotor processing. However, part of this variability might result from operant learning. We tested this hypothesis by reinforcing dispersions of saccadic amplitude distributions, while maintaining constant their medians. In a first experiment we reinforced the least frequent saccadic amplitudes to increase variability, and then reinforced the central part of the amplitude distributions to reduce variability. The target was placed at a constant distance from the fovea after the saccade to maintain the postsaccadic visual signal constant and an auditory reinforcement was delivered depending on saccadic amplitude. The second experiment tested the effects of the contingency. We reinforced high levels of variability in 4 participants, whereas 4 other participants were assigned to a yoked control group. On average, saccadic amplitude standard deviations were doubled while the medians remained mostly unchanged in the experimental participants in both experiments, and variability returned to baseline level when low variability was reinforced. In the control group no consistent changes in amplitude distributions were observed. These results, showing that variability can be reinforced, challenge the idea of a stochastic neural noise. We instead propose that selection processes constrain saccadic amplitude distributions.},

	abstract = {Visual tracking of moving objects re-quires prediction to compensate for visual delays and minimize mismatches between eye and target position and velocity. In everyday life, objects often disappear behind an occluder, and prediction is required to align eye and target at reappearance. Earlier studies investigating eye motion during target blanking showed that eye velocity first decayed after disappearance but was sustained or often recovered in a predictive way. Furthermore, saccades were directed toward the unseen target trajectory and therefore appeared to correct for position errors resulting from eye velocity decay. To investigate the synergy between smooth and saccadic eye movements, this study used a target blanking paradigm where both position and velocity of the target at reappearance could vary independently but were pre-sented repeatedly to facilitate prediction. We found that eye velocity at target reappearance was only influenced by expected target veloc-ity, whereas saccades responded to the expected change of target position at reappearance. Moreover, subjects exhibited on-line adap-tation, on a trial-by-trial basis, between smooth and saccadic compo-nents; i.e., saccades compensated for variability of smooth eye dis-placement during the blanking period such that gaze at target reap-pearance was independent of the level of smooth eye displacement. We suggest these results indicate that information arising from effer-ence copies of saccadic and smooth pursuit systems are combined with the goal of adjusting eye position at target reappearance. Based on prior experimental evidence, we hypothesize that this spatial remapping is carried out through interactions between a number of identified neurophysiological structures.},

	abstract = {The precision of smooth pursuit eye movements was described by means of a new dependent measure, the "oculomotor difference threshold" (analogous to the perceptual difference threshold) which represents the smallest difference in target velocity that produces statistically distinguishable differences in eye velocity. Oculomotor difference thresholds for constant velocity motions were largest (50\% of target velocity) during the initial 200msec of target motion, despite fairly high average gains (0.7-1.4) during the same period. Oculomotor difference thresholds declined over time. By about 600-700 msec after the onset of target motion they reached values as low as the perceptual difference thresholds measured psychophysically with the same target velocities. The similarity of the difference thresholds suggests that equally precise sensory representations of target velocity influenced perception and smooth eye movements. Nonsensory influences on smooth eye movement were also found. Smooth pursuit velocity: 1. (1) depended on the velocity of targets in preceding trials; 2. (2) was decreased during the initial 200 msec of target motion when the duration of motion was reduced from 1 sec to 200 msec, a result which shows that high initial pursuit velocity depends on the expectation that pursuit will continue. These effects of context and expected duration allowed the eye to achieve quickly a velocity close to that of the target it was most likely to encounter. Study of the precision of pursuit may be valuable for characterizing its sensory input, but study of the effects of the context in which a stimulus appears and the effects of expectations about future target motion may be more valuable for understanding how smooth eye movements guarantee retinal image velocities optimal for vision. © 1987.},

	abstract = {Prior work had shown that smooth eye movements depend both on the motion of the target on the retina and on the subject's expectations about future target motion (Kowler and Steinman. 1979a,b). Effects of expectation cannot be eliminated by making target motions unpredictable (Kowler and Steinman. 1981). The experiment reported here shows that effects of expectations on smooth eye movement depend in a lawful way on the history of prior target motions. Anticipatory smooth eye movements (involuntary drifts in the direction of future target motion) were measured while subjects fixated a stationary target that was expected to step in an unpredictable direction (right or left). Anticipatory smooth eye movement velocity depended on the sequence of steps in prior trials e.g. velocity was faster to the right when the prior steps were to the right. The influence of prior steps diminished the further back into the past the step occurred. Sequential dependencies were also observed for the saccades used to track the target steps. Anticipatory smooth eye movement velocity was predicted by a two-state Markov model developed by Falmagne et al. (1975) for similar sequential dependencies observed in a manual reaction-time task (button-pressing). The model uses the prior sequence of target motions to predict the subject's expectation and assumes that the expectation determines anticipatory smooth eye movement velocity. The fit of the model to the data was good which shows that taking expectations into account is both necessary and feasible. Taking expectations into account, quantitatively, allows accurate predictions about smooth eye movement velocity when target motions are unpredictable. © 1984.},

Slow-timescale disturbances occur when muscles are damaged or when limb dynamics change as a result of development. To maintain performance, motor commands need to adapt. Computing the best adaptation in response to any performance error results in a credit assignment problem: which timescale is responsible for this disturbance? Here we show that a Bayesian solution to this problem accounts for numerous behaviors of animals during both short- and long-term training. Our analysis focused on characteristics of the oculomotor system during learning, including the effects of time passage. However, we suggest that learning and memory in other paradigms, such as reach adaptation, adaptation of visual neurons and retrieval of declarative memories, largely follow similar rules.},

The model-based approach allows capturing latent decision-making processes such as strategic adjustments of response thresholds and relate these to interindividual differences or single-trial blood-oxygenated level dependent ({BOLD}) functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ({fMRI}) responses. The review shows that different cortico-subcortical networks are responsive to different latent decision-making processes. More concretely, we show that evidence accumulation is associated with a fronto-parietal network which is partly overlapping with choice bias in perceptual decision making. The setting of decision thresholds is associated with fronto-basal ganglia networks which are also found for choice bias. In sum, we argue that the model-based approach holds great promises to understand the neural correlates of latent cognitive processes. © 2014 {IBRO}.},

	abstract = {A target moving physically in discrete spatial jumps could elicit smooth tracking eye movements in practised observers, but this tracking was increasingly interrupted by saccades when the temporal interval between the spatial jumps of the target was greater than 150 msec. A target that could elicit and sustain smooth tracking appeared perceptually to be moving continuously, rather than discretely, even when the eyes were voluntarily prevented from following the target. An objective measure of this perceived continuity of an apparently moving target, based upon the effects of an interocular delay on apparent depth, showed that perceptual continuity also broke down when the inter-flash interval exceeded a critical value. However, the breakdown in perceived continuity began at a smaller inter-flash interval than the breakdown in smooth pursuit. These results are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that the neural mechanism underlying smooth eye tracking may also be involved in the perception of continuous motion, even when overt eye movements are voluntarily prevented. © 1978.},

	abstract = {In order to extract information from the visual world, it is necessary to bring the images of objects of interest to rest on the high acuity part of the retina, the fovea. Primates, including humans, use two types of eye movement, saccades and smooth pursuit, to accomplish this. While classically conceived of as being separate and distinct, various lines of evidence indicate a close linkage between these two eye movement systems. They are often investigated at a behavioural level by presenting subjects with single targets to saccade or to track. We investigated the effect of presenting a single stationary distractor at various positions in the visual field at the same time as a moving target which subjects were instructed to track. We found that while a stationary distractor presented in the contralateral visual field and part of the ipsilateral visual field increased pursuit latency in an eccentricity dependent manner, a distractor presented in the ipsilateral visual field, within 45 degrees of the axis along which the pursuit target moved, had no effect on latency. We found no evidence that within this region distractors modified eye velocity during the early part of the pursuit response. This spatial pattern of the effect of a stationary distractor on pursuit latency is very similar to the effect of distractors on saccade latency. Our results provide behavioural evidence supporting the hypothesis that the processes that determine when an eye movement is made are linked, but that those determining the form of that eye movement are substantially independent.},

Since the success of this neurosurgical approach to dopamine-replacement therapy may depend on the selection of the most appropriate subregion of the striatum for implantation, we examined the pattern and degree of dopamine loss in striatum obtained at autopsy from eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. We found that in the putamen there was a nearly complete depletion of dopamine in all subdivisions, with the greatest reduction in the caudal portions (less than 1 percent of the dopamine remaining). In the caudate nucleus, the only subdivision with severe dopamine reduction was the most dorsal rostral part (4 percent of the dopamine remaining); the other subdivisions still had substantial levels of dopamine (up to approximately 40 percent of control levels). We propose that the motor deficits that are a constant and characteristic feature of idiopathic Parkinson's disease are for the most part a consequence of dopamine loss in the putamen, and that the dopamine-related caudate deficits (in "higher" cognitive functions) are, if present, less marked or restricted to discrete functions only. We conclude that the putamen--particularly its caudal portions--may be the most appropriate site for intrastriatal application of dopamine-producing autografts in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.},

	abstract = {It has long been recognized that the amplitude of the P300 component of event--related brain potentials is sensitive to the degree to which eliciting stimuli are surprising to the observers (Donchin, 1981). While Squires et al. (1976) showed and modeled dependencies of P300 amplitudes from observed stimuli on various time scales, Mars et al. (2008) proposed a computational model keeping track of stimulus probabilities on a long--term time scale. We suggest here a computational model which integrates prior information with short--term, long--term, and alternation--based experiential influences on P300 amplitude fluctuations. To evaluate the new model, we measured trial--by--trial P300 amplitude fluctuations in a simple two--choice response time task, and tested the computational models of trial--by--trial P300 amplitudes using Bayesian model evaluation. The results reveal that the new digital filtering ({DIF}) model provides a superior account of the trial--by--trial P300 amplitudes when compared to both, Squires et al.'s (1976) model, and Mars et al.'s (2008) model. We show that the P300--generating system can be described as two parallel first--order infinite impulse response ({IIR}) low--pass filters and an additional fourth--order finite impulse response ({FIR}) high--pass filter. Implications of the acquired data are discussed with regard to the neurobiological distinction between short--term, long--term, and working memory as well as from the point of view of predictive coding models and Bayesian learning theories of cortical function.},

These results can be interpreted in two ways: either {PD} patients are hypersensitive to immediate outcomes and/or insensitive to delayed consequences or {PD} patients are hypersensitive to rewards and/or insensitive to punishments. In this study, we used a modified {IGT} in which selection of cards from the disadvantageous decks leads to immediate, small punishments and delayed, smaller rewards and selection of cards from the advantageous decks leads to immediate, large punishments and delayed larger rewards. We then compared the results obtained using this modified {IGT} with those obtained using the original {IGT}. If the {PD} patients were hypersensitive to the immediate outcomes of decisions, they would make disadvantageous choices in both the original and the modified {IGTs}. Differences between the results of the original and modified tasks would indicate impairments in balancing reward and punishment. In our analysis, {PD} patients selected advantageous decks and gained as much as normal subjects during the modified {IGT}, but they selected disadvantageous decks during the original {IGT}. These results indicate that the decision-making difficulties of {PD} patients are caused by their inability to balance reward and punishment and their hypersensitivity to reward and/or insensitivity to punishment. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We present a model for how such errors could be constructed in a real brain that is consistent with physiological results for a subset of dopaminergic neurons located in the ventral tegmental area and surrounding dopaminergic neurons. The theory also makes testable predictions about human choice behavior on a simple decision-making task.

	abstract = {Smooth-pursuit eye movements were recorded in two rhesus monkeys in order to compare the influence of structured visual backgrounds on smooth-pursuit initiation, steady-state pursuit and pursuit termination. Different target trajectories were used in order to study smooth-pursuit initiation and termination. The influence of visual backgrounds on pursuit initiation was characterized by recording ocular responses elicited by step-ramp target displacements starting from straight ahead. Pursuit termination was characterized by analysing the transition from steady-state smooth-pursuit to fixation when a centripetally directed target ramp was terminated by a small target step in the direction of the ramp as soon as the target had come close to the straightahead position. The quantification of steady-state pursuit was based on ocular responses elicited by either paradigm. In accordance with previous work, we found that the onset of smooth-pursuit eye movements was delayed and initial eye acceleration reduced in the presence of a structured visual background. Likewise, mean eye velocity during steady-state pursuit was reduced by structured visual backgrounds. However, neither the latency nor the time course of smooth-pursuit termination was altered when the homogeneous background was replaced by a structured visual background. The lack of sensitivity of pursuit termination to the presence of visual structured backgrounds supports a previous contention that pursuit termination is mediated by a process which is different from the ones mediating smooth-pursuit initiation and steady-state pursuit. The absence of any noticeable effect of structured backgrounds on pursuit termination suggests that at least the fast component of the optokinetic reflex is suppressed during pursuit termination.},

However, experiments on saccadic eye movements are usually designed in such a way that oculomotor performance is dissociated from the natural role of saccades, namely that of making crucial perceptual information rapidly available for high-resolution, foveal analysis. Here, we demonstrate that the requirement to perform a difficult perceptual judgment at the saccade landing location can reduce saccadic latency (by 15\%) and increase saccadic peak velocity. Importantly, the effect cannot be explained in terms of arousal, as latency changes are specific to the location where the perceptual judgement is required. These results indicate that mechanisms for voluntary saccade initiation are under the powerful indirect control of perceptual goals.},

	abstract = {1. The initial ocular pursuit of small target spots (0.25 degrees diam) that suddenly start to move at constant speed (ramps) was recorded in four rhesus monkeys with the electromagnetic search coil technique. All target motions were horizontal, and both eyes were monitored. 2. In agreement with the observations of Keller and Khan, stationary textured backgrounds substantially reduced the initial eye acceleration achieved during pursuit but did not affect its latency. Correlation techniques were used to assess the changes in the eye speed profiles and indicated that the reduction in eye acceleration due to the background was a linear function of the logarithm of target speed over the range investigated (5-40 degrees/s), averaging 60\% with the fastest targets. 3. Selectively excluding the background texture from the path of the target with a horizontal strip of card (vertical width, 4 degrees) reduced the impact of the background only slightly, and, even when the vertical width of the card was increased to 60 degrees, the effect of the background was not entirely eliminated. Thus the effect involves regions of the visual field well beyond the target and is not due simply to the reduced physical salience (contrast) of the target spot. Such spatially remote interactions suggest that the neurons decoding the targets motion have very extensive visual receptive fields. 4. Textured backgrounds also caused similar reductions in the eye acceleration during initial pursuit when, before the ramps, the fixated target spots stepped forward, i.e., stepped in the direction of the subsequent ramps (step ramps). In this situation, as with no steps, initial target ramps were foveofugal. When the fixated target spots were stepped back before moving forward so that initial target ramps were foveopetal, textured backgrounds now also delayed the onset of pursuit, and the reductions in eye acceleration were not seen until some time later when tracking resulted from foveofugal target-ramp motion. Selectively excluding the texture from the path of the target with a narrow strip of card eliminated any delays in the onset of pursuit to step ramps, but the later reductions in eye acceleration were still evident. These step-ramp data indicate that the mechanisms decoding foveofugal and foveopetal target ramps differ markedly in their sensitivity to textured backgrounds. That backgrounds can influence the latency and the initial eye acceleration independently is consistent with the idea that there are independent trigger and drive mechanisms for the decoding of target motions.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

The to-be-attended object was indicated by peripheral or central cues. Strong reductions of pursuit gain occurred when the following conditions were met: (a) the subject payed attention to the object (b) a salient event was present, for instance the onset of the target or cue and (c) the attended target produced retinal motion. Removing any of the three conditions resulted in no or far smaller decreases of pursuit gain.

Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements. Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development: Children discover that object category labels can be organized into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques, and comparative relations (e.g., "bigger than" or "better than") respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however, can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering create tree structures, whereas algorithms for dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we present a computational model that learns structures of many different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of graph grammars representing trees, linear orders, multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques, and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying structure of a variety of physical, biological, and social domains. Our approach brings structure learning methods closer to human abilities and may lead to a deeper computational understanding of cognitive development.},

	abstract = {The basal ganglia comprise several nuclei in the forebrain, diencephalon, and midbrain thought to play a significant role in the control of posture and movement. It is well recognized that people with degenerative diseases of the basal ganglia suffer from rigidly held abdominal body postures, slowing of movement, involuntary movements, or a combination of these abnormalities. However, it has not been agreed just what the basal ganglia contribute to normal movement. Recent advances in knowledge of the basal ganglia circuity, activity of basal ganglia neurons during movement, and the effect of basal ganglia lesions have led to a new hypothesis of basal ganglia function. The hypothesis states that the basal ganglia do not generate movements. Instead, when voluntary movement is generated by cerebral cortical and cerebellar mechanisms that would otherwise interfere with the desired movement. Simultaneously, inhibition is removed focally from the desired motor mechanisms to allow that movement to proceed. Inability to inhibit competing motor programs results in slow movements, abnormal postures and involuntary muscle activity.},

We developed a task in which participants are free to exert a physical effort knowing that their payoff would be proportional to their effort duration. Functional {MRI} and magnetoencephalography recordings conjointly revealed that the theoretical cost evidence accumulation signal was expressed in proprioceptive regions (bilateral posterior insula). Furthermore, the slopes and bounds of the accumulation process were adapted to the difficulty of the task and the money at stake. Cost evidence accumulation might therefore provide a dynamical mechanistic account of how the human brain maximizes benefits while preventing exhaustion.},

	abstract = {Anticipatory movements are motor responses occurring before likely sensory events in contrast to reflexive actions. Anticipatory movements are necessary to compensate for delays present in sensory and motor systems. Smooth pursuit eye movements are often used as a paradigmatic example for the study of anticipation. However, the neural control of anticipatory pursuit is unknown. A previous study suggested that the supplementary eye fields ({SEFs}) could play a role in the guidance of smooth pursuit to predictable target motion. In this study, we favored anticipatory responses in monkeys by making the parameters of target motion highly predictable and electrically stimulated the {SEF} before and during this behavior. Stimulation sites were restricted to regions of the {SEF} where saccades could not be evoked at the same low currents. We found that electrical microstimulation in the {SEF} increased the velocity of anticipatory pursuit movements and decreased their latency. These effects will be referred to as anticipatory pursuit facilitation. The degree of facilitation was the largest if the stimulation train was delivered near the end of the fixation period, before the moment when anticipatory pursuit usually begins. No anticipatory smooth eye movements could be evoked during fixation without an expectation of target motion. These results suggest that the {SEF} pursuit area might be involved in the process of guiding anticipatory pursuit.},

Early investigations contributed to the concept of subcortical dementia associated with bradyphrenia and cognitive rigidity. For cognition in parkinsonian disorders, this notion developed into the concept of mild cognitive impairment and fronto-executive dysfunction in particular, driven mainly by dopaminergic dysmodulation and manifesting as deficits in flexibility, planning, working memory, and reinforcement learning. However, patients with Parkinson's disease could also develop a syndrome of dementia that might depend on non-dopaminergic, cholinergic cortical dysfunction. Recent findings, supplemented by advances in neuroimaging and genetic research, reveal substantial heterogeneity in the range of cognitive deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease. Remediation and management prospects for these cognitive deficits are based on neuropharmacological and cognitive rehabilitation approaches. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The primary motor cortex is important for motor learning and response selection, functions that require information on the expected and actual outcomes of behavior. Therefore, it should receive signals related to reward. Pathways from reward centers to motor cortex exist in primates. Previously, we showed that gamma aminobutyric acid-A-mediated inhibition in the motor cortex, measured by paired transcranial magnetic stimulation, changes with expectation and uncertainty of money rewards generated by a slot machine simulation. We examined the role of dopamine in this phenomenon by testing 13 mildly affected patients with Parkinson's disease, off and on dopaminergic medications, and 13 healthy, age-matched controls. Consistent with a dopaminergic mechanism, reward expectation or predictability modulated the response to paired transcranial magnetic stimulation in controls, but not in unmedicated patients. A single dose of pramipexole restored this effect of reward, mainly by increasing the paired transcranial magnetic stimulation response amplitude during low expectation. Levodopa produced no such effect. Both pramipexole and levodopa increased risk-taking behavior on the Iowa Gambling Task. However, pramipexole increased risk-taking behavior more in patients showing lower paired transcranial magnetic stimulation response amplitude during low expectation. These results provide evidence that modulation of motor cortex inhibition by reward is mediated by dopamine signaling and that the physiological state of the motor cortex changes with risk-taking tendency in patients on pramipexole. The cortical response to reward expectation may represent an endophenotype for risk-taking behavior in patients on agonist treatment.},

	abstract = {Visual neurons show fast adaptive behavior in response to brief visual input. However, the perceptual consequences of this rapid neural adaptation are less known. Here, we show that brief exposure to a moving adaptation stimulus-ranging from tens to hundreds of milliseconds-influences the perception of a subsequently presented ambiguous motion test stimulus. Whether the ambiguous motion is perceived to move in the same direction (priming), or in the opposite direction (rapid motion aftereffect) varies systematically with the duration of the adaptation stimulus and the adaptation-test blank interval. These biases appear and decay rapidly. Moreover, when the adapting stimulus is itself ambiguous, these effects are not produced. Instead, the percept for the subsequent test stimulus is biased to the perceived direction of the adaptation stimulus. This effect (perceptual sensitization) builds gradually over the time between the adaptation and test stimuli. Our results indicate that rapid adaptation plays a role mainly within early motion processing, whereas a slow potentiation controls the sensitivity at a later stage. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

I assumed that typical series serve as a norm to which other series are compared, and predicted a positive bias in the perception of covariation. This prediction was tested and found to hold across a wide range of actual relationships in 2 experiments involving sequential dependencies and events with co-occurring values. Another analysis revealed positive correlations to be more informative than negative ones when events are not equiprobable. Positive bias may thus be a rational predisposition for early detection of a potentially more informative relationship. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2003 {APA} )},

After repeated presentations of the same target trajectory, infrequent probe trials of purely horizontal target motion evoked a vertical eye movement around the time when the change in target direction would have occurred. The pursuit system timed the vertical eye movement by keeping track of the duration of horizontal target motion and by measuring the distance the target traveled before changing direction, but not by learning the position in space where the target changed direction.

	abstract = {We provide evidence that the saccadic system can simultaneously program two saccades to different goals. We presented subjects with simple visual search displays in which they were required to make a saccade to an odd-colored target embedded in an array of distractors. When there was strong competition between target and distractor stimuli (due to color priming from previous trials), subjects were more likely to make a saccade to a distractor. Such error saccades were often followed, after a very short inter-saccadic interval (̃10-100 ms), by a second saccade to the target. The brevity of these inter-saccadic intervals suggests that the programming of the two saccades (one to a distractor and one to the target) overlapped in time. Using a saccade-contingent change in the search display, we show that new visual information presented during the initial saccade does not change the goal of the second saccade. This supports the idea that, by the end of the first saccade, programming of the second saccade is already well underway. We also elicited two-saccade responses (similar to those seen in search) using a double-step task, with the first saccade directed to the initial target step and the second saccade directed to the second target step. If the two saccades are programmed in parallel and programming of each saccade is triggered by one of the two target steps, the second saccade should occur at a relatively fixed time after the onset of the second target step, regardless of the timing of the initial saccade. This prediction was confirmed, supporting the idea that the two saccades are programmed in parallel. Finally, we observed that the shortest inter-saccadic intervals typically followed hypometric initial saccades, suggesting that the initial saccade may have been interrupted by the impending second saccade. Using predictions from physiological studies of interrupted saccades, we tested this hypothesis and found that the hypometric initial saccades did not appear to be interrupted in mid-flight. We discuss the significance of our findings for models of the saccadic system. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Using a learning criterion in a probabilistic object reversal task, we found a learning stage by age interaction in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({dlPFC}) during decision making. While young adults recruited the {dlPFC} in an early stage of learning reward associations, older adults recruited the {dlPFC} when reward associations had already been learned. Furthermore, we found a reduced change in ventral striatal {BOLD} signal in older as compared to younger adults in response to high probability rewards. Our data are in line with behavioral evidence that older adults show altered stimulus-reward learning and support the view of an altered fronto-striatal interaction during reward-based decision making in old age, which contributes to prolonged learning of reward associations.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder with evolving layers of complexity. It has long been characterised by the classical motor features of parkinsonism associated with Lewy bodies and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. However, the symptomatology of Parkinson's disease is now recognised as heterogeneous, with clinically significant non-motor features. Similarly, its pathology involves extensive regions of the nervous system, various neurotransmitters, and protein aggregates other than just Lewy bodies. The cause of Parkinson's disease remains unknown, but risk of developing Parkinson's disease is no longer viewed as primarily due to environmental factors. Instead, Parkinson's disease seems to result from a complicated interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting numerous fundamental cellular processes. The complexity of Parkinson's disease is accompanied by clinical challenges, including an inability to make a definitive diagnosis at the earliest stages of the disease and difficulties in the management of symptoms at later stages. Furthermore, there are no treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process. In this Seminar, we review these complexities and challenges of Parkinson's disease.},

	issn = {0270-6474},
	abstract = {Learning was induced in smooth pursuit eye movements by repeated presentation of targets that moved at one speed for 100 msec and then changed to a second, higher or lower, speed. The learned changes, measured as eye acceleration for the first 100 msec of pursuit, were largest in a "late" interval from 50 to 80 msec after the onset of pursuit and were smaller and less consistent in the earliest 30 msec of pursuit. In each experiment, target motion in one direction consisted of learning trials, whereas target motion in the opposite (control) direction consisted of trials in which targets moved at a constant speed for the entire duration of the trial. Under these conditions, the learning did not generalize to the control direction. For target motion in the learning direction, the changes in pursuit generalized to responses evoked by targets moving at speeds ranging from 15 to 45 degrees/sec as well as to targets of different colors and sizes. Although learning was induced at the initiation of pursuit, it generalized to the response to image motion in the learning direction when it was presented during pursuit in the learning direction. However, learning did not generalize to the response to image motion in the learning direction when it was presented during pursuit in the control direction. The results suggest that the learning does not occur in purely sensory or motor coordinates but in an intermediate reference frame at least partly defined by the direction of eye movement. The selectivity of learning provides new evidence for a previously hypothesized neural "switch" that gates visual information on the basis of movement direction. This selectivity also suggests that the locus of pursuit learning is in pathways related to the operation of the switch.},

Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word “reinforcement.” The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

	abstract = {We followed simple- and complex-spike firing of Purkinje cells ({PCs}) in the floccular complex of the cerebellum through learned modifications of the pursuit eye movements of two monkeys. Learning was induced by double steps of target speed in which initially stationary targets move at a "learning" speed for 100 ms and then change to either a higher or lower speed in the same direction. In randomly interleaved control trials, targets moved at the learning speed in the opposite direction. When the learning direction was the {ON} direction for simple-spike responses, learning was associated with statistically significant changes in simple-spike firing for 10 of 32 {PCs}. Of the 10 {PCs} that showed significant expressions of learning, 8 showed changes in simple-spike output in the expected direction: increased or decreased firing when eye acceleration increased or decreased through learning. There were no statistically significant changes in simple-spike responses or eye acceleration during pursuit in the control direction. When the learning direction was in the {OFF} direction for simple-spike responses, none of 15 {PCs} showed significant correlates of learning. Although changes in simple-spike firing were recorded in only a subset of {PCs}, analysis of the population response showed that the same relationship between population firing and eye acceleration obtained before and after learning. Thus learning is associated with changes that render the modified population response appropriate to drive the changed behavior. To analyze complex-spike firing during learning we correlated complex-spike firing in the second, third, and fourth 100 ms after the onset of target motion with the retinal image motion in the previous 100 ms. Data were largely consistent with previous evidence that image motion drives complex spikes with a direction selectivity opposite that for simple spikes. Comparison of complex-spike responses at different times after the onset of control and learning target motions in the learning direction implied that complex spikes could guide learning during decreases but not increases in eye acceleration. Learning caused increases or decreases in the sensitivity of complex spikes to image motion in parallel with changes in eye acceleration. Complex-spike responses were similar in all {PCs}, including many in which learning did not modify simple-spike responses. Our data do not disprove current theories of cerebellar learning but suggest that these theories would have to be modified to account for simple- and complex-spike firing of floccular Purkinje cells reported here.},

	abstract = {Primates can generate accurate, smooth eye-movement responses to moving target objects of arbitrary shape and size, even in the presence of complex backgrounds and/or the extraneous motion of non-target objects. Most previous studies of pursuit have simply used a spot moving over a featureless background as the target and have thus neglected critical issues associated with the general problem of recovering object motion. Visual psychophysicists and theoreticians have shown that, for arbitrary objects with multiple features at multiple orientations, object-motion estimation for perception is a complex, multi-staged, time-consuming process. To examine the temporal evolution of the motion signal driving pursuit, we recorded the tracking eye movements of human observers to moving line-figure diamonds. We found that pursuit is initially biased in the direction of the vector average of the motions of the diamond's line segments and gradually converges to the true object-motion direction with a time constant of approximately 90 ms. Furthermore, transient blanking of the target during steady-state pursuit induces a decrease in tracking speed, which, unlike pursuit initiation, is subsequently corrected without an initial direction bias. These results are inconsistent with current models in which pursuit is driven by retinal-slip error correction. They demonstrate that pursuit models must be revised to include a more complete visual afferent pathway, which computes, and to some extent latches on to, an accurate estimate of object direction over the first hundred milliseconds or so of motion.},

Computational models derived from single-unit recordings capture changes in dopaminergic neuron firing rate as a prediction error signal. These models employ the prediction error signal in two roles: learning to predict future rewarding events and biasing action choice. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition or lesion of dopaminergic neuron function diminishes the ability of an animal to motivate behaviors directed at acquiring rewards. These lesion experiments have raised the possibility that dopamine release encodes a measure of the incentive value of a contemplated behavioral act. The most complete psychological idea that captures this notion frames the dopamine signal as carrying 'incentive salience'. On the surface, these two competing accounts of dopamine function seem incommensurate. To the contrary, we demonstrate that both of these functions can be captured in a single computational model of the involvement of dopamine in reward prediction for the purpose of reward seeking.},

To probe how and where reward systems alter motor behavior, we studied smooth pursuit eye movements in monkeys trained to associate the color of a visual cue with the size of the reward to be issued at the end of the target motion. When the tracking task presented two different colored targets that moved orthogonally, monkeys biased the initiation of pursuit toward the direction of motion of the target that led to larger reward. The bias was larger than expected given the modest effects of reward size on tracking of single targets. Experiments with three different reward sizes suggested that the bias afforded a given target depends mainly on the size of the larger reward. To analyze the effect of reward on directional learning in pursuit, monkeys tracked a single moving target that changed direction 250 ms after the onset of motion. Expectation of a larger reward led to a larger learned eye movement during the acquisition of the learned response and during subsequent probes of what had been learned, implying that reward influenced the expression rather than the acquisition of learning. The specific effects of reward size on learning and two-target stimuli imply that the site of reward modulation is at a level where multiple target motions compete for control of eye movement, downstream from sensory processing and learning and upstream from final motor processing.},

This review describes the clinical characteristics of {PD} with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders. {METHODS} A {MedLine} search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of {PD}. Search terms included "Parkinson's disease", "diagnosis" and "signs and symptoms". {RESULTS} Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of {PD}, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of {PD}. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate {PD} from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than {PD}. {CONCLUSIONS} A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of {PD} is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease.

The Iowa Gambling Task ({GT}) is mediated primarily through ventromedial-prefrontal systems, and poor performance on this measure ("cognitive impulsivity") is common among substance dependent individuals ({SDIs}) as well as patients with disease involving prefrontal-subcortical systems (e.g., Huntington disease). We hypothesized that {HIV}+ {SDIs} might be more vulnerable to cognitive impulsivity when compared with {HIV}-seronegative ({HIV}-) {SDIs} because recent studies report evidence of additive effects of {HIV} serostatus and drug dependence on cognition. Further, working memory is considered a key component of {GT} performance and is reliably impaired among {HIV}+ {SDIs} compared to controls. We administered the {GT} to 46 {HIV}+ and 47 well-matched {HIV}- males with a past or current history of substance dependence. In addition, we evaluated correlations between subjects' scores on the {GT} and on a delayed nonmatch to sample ({DNMS}) task in order to test if working memory deficits accounted for cognitive impulsivity among the {HIV}+ subjects. The {HIV}+ subjects performed significantly more poorly on the {GT} compared to the {HIV}- group but this effect could not be explained by working memory deficits.

So, our visual system has a built-in paradox - we must fix our gaze to inspect the minute details of our world, but if we were to fixate perfectly, the entire world would fade from view. Owing to their role in counteracting adaptation, fixational eye movements have been studied to elucidate how the brain makes our environment visible. Moreover, because we are not aware of these eye movements, they have been studied to understand the underpinnings of visual awareness.

Motor neuroprostheses are widely investigated in behaving non-human primates, but technical constraints have limited progress in optimizing performance. In particular, the organization of movement-related neuronal activity across cortical layers remains poorly understood due, in part, to the widespread use of fixed-geometry multielectrode arrays. In this study, we use chronically implanted multielectrode arrays with individually movable electrodes to examine how the encoding of movement goals depends on cortical depth. In a series of recordings spanning several months, we varied the depth of each electrode in the prearcuate gyrus of frontal cortex in two monkeys as they performed memory-guided eye movements. We decode eye movement goals from local field potentials ({LFPs}) and multiunit spiking activity recorded across a range of depths up to 3 mm from the cortical surface. We show that both {LFP} and multiunit signals yield the highest decoding performance at superficial sites, within 0.5 mm of the cortical surface, while performance degrades substantially at sites deeper than 1 mm. We also analyze performance by varying bandpass filtering characteristics and simulating changes in microelectrode array channel count and density. The results indicate that the performance of {LFP}-based neuroprostheses strongly depends on recording configuration and that recording depth is a critical parameter limiting system performance.},

	abstract = {Recent researches reported behavioral and emotional impairment in Parkinson's disease ({PD}), even in the earliest stages. This impairment affects also decision-making and learning processes. The Iowa gambling task ({IGT}) is commonly used to examine the decision-making capacity. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the neural correlates of feedback evaluation in the decision-making process into a learning context, using {IGT} and event-related potentials ({ERPs}) in a group of non-demented medicated {PD} patients. Fifteen {PD} patients and 15 healthy controls were recruited for the study. {PD} patients were administrated a basic neuropsychological assessment oriented to exclude cognitive impairments. Both groups underwent the computerized {IGT} during electroencephalography ({EEG}) registration. To analyse {ERPs}, continuous {EEG} data were epoched within a time-window starting 1000 ms before and ending 1000 ms after feedback presentation and averaged separately for positive (i.e., win condition) and negative (i.e., loss condition) feedbacks. Behavioral data revealed a significant lower performance of {PD} patients (p  0.05) compared with the controls. While controls demonstrated a correct feedback evaluation, {PD} patients did not show any learning, selecting more disadvantageous decks even in the last part of task. Furthermore, {ERPs} results revealed that controls showed a significant difference (p  0.05) in {ERPs} morphology recorded after the win and the loss conditions, suggesting that positive and negative feedbacks were differently evaluated and processed. {PD} patients showed a different pattern: their {ERPs} morphology was the same for positive and negative feedback. Interestingly, our {ERPs} results suggest that in {PD} patients an incorrect evaluation of context-relevant outcomes could be the reason of a poor performance in decision-making tasks, and could explain cognitive and behavioral problems related to impulse control disorder.},

	abstract = {Recent work has suggested an association between the orbitofrontal cortex in humans and practical decision making. The aim of this study was to investigate the profile of cognitive deficits, with particular emphasis on decision-making processes, following damage to different sectors of the human prefrontal cortex. Patients with discrete orbitofrontal ({OBF}) lesions, dorsolateral ({DL}) lesions, dorsomedial ({DM}) lesions and large frontal lesions (Large) were compared with matched controls on three different decision-making tasks: the Iowa Gambling Task and two recently developed tasks that attempt to fractionate some of the cognitive components of the Iowa task. A comprehensive battery including the assessment of recognition memory, working memory, planning ability and attentional set-shifting was also administered. Whilst combined frontal patients were impaired on several of the tasks employed, distinct profiles emerged for each patient group. In contrast to previous data, patients with focal {OBF} lesions performed at control levels on the three decision-making tasks (and the executive tasks), but showed some evidence of prolonged deliberation. {DL} patients showed pronounced impairment on working memory, planning, attentional shifting and the Iowa Gambling Task. {DM} patients were impaired at the Iowa Gambling Task and also at planning. The Large group displayed diffuse impairment, but were the only group to exhibit risky decision making. Methodological differences from previous studies of {OBF} patient groups are discussed, with particular attention to lesion laterality, lesion size and psychiatric presentation. Ventral and dorsal aspects of prefrontal cortex must interact in the maintenance of rational and,non-risky' decision making.},

	abstract = {Mycotoxins are small ({MW} approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction ({LLE}), supercritical fluid extraction ({SFE}), solid phase extraction ({SPE}), (b) separation methods such as ({TLC}), high performance liquid chromatography ({HPLC}), gas chromatography ({GC}), and capillary electrophoresis ({CE}) and (c) others such as {ELISA}. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The reliance of the former on systems of representation (comparators, transducers, schemas etc.), not open to observation, is shown to give rise to a number of theoretical and applied problems. While Skinner's approach is shown to avoid such assumptions it is, in turn, limited in the explanations it provides for behavioural change by its undue emphasis on why things are done at the expense of how they are done. It is argued that recent developments in Ecological Psychology, particularly dynamical systems approaches, provide novel solutions to the question of how things are done but, in so doing, lose track of the why. In spite of the limitations of either perspective on its own, there does seem to be sufficient (fundamental) communality and complementarity to provide the basis for a rapprochement that can lead to a better understanding of behaviour in general and motor behaviour in particular. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Although impaired smooth-pursuit in Parkinson's disease ({PD}) is well known, reports are conflicting on the ability to cancel vestibulo-ocular reflex ({VOR}) when the target moves with head, requiring gaze-pursuit. To compare visual tracking performance with or without passive whole-body rotation, we examined eye movements of 10 {PD} patients and 6 age-matched controls during sinusoidal horizontal smooth-pursuit and passive whole-body rotation (0.3 Hz, +/- 10 degrees ). Three tasks were tested: smooth-pursuit, {VOR} cancellation, and {VORx}1 while subjects fixated an earth-stationary spot during whole-body rotation. Mean +/- {SD} eye velocity gains (eye velocities/stimulus velocities) of {PD} patients during the 3 tasks were 0.32 +/- 0.24 0.25 +/- 0.22, 0.85 +/- 0.20, whereas those of controls were 0.91 +/- 0.06, 0.14 +/- 0.07, 0.94 +/- 0.05, respectively. Difference was significant between the two subject groups only during smooth-pursuit. Plotting eye-velocity gains of individual subjects during {VOR} cancellation against those during smooth-pursuit revealed significant negative linear correlation between the two parameters in the controls, but no correlation was found in {PD} patients. Based on the regression equation of the controls, we estimated expected eye velocity gains of individual subjects during {VOR} cancellation from their smooth-pursuit gains. Estimated gains of {PD} patients during {VOR} cancellation were significantly different from their actual gains, suggesting that different neural mechanisms operate during {VOR} cancellation in the controls and {PD}.},

First published April 27, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00669.2010.---The frontal pursuit area ({FPA}) lies posterior to the frontal eye fields in the frontal cortex and contains neurons that are directionally selective for pursuit eye move-ments. Lesions of the {FPA} (alternately called " {FEFsem} ") cause deficits in pursuit acceleration and velocity, which are largest for movements directed toward the lesioned side. Conversely, stimulation of the {FPA} evokes pursuit from fixation and increases the gain of the pursuit response. On the basis of these properties, it has been hypoth-esized that the {FPA} could underlie the selection of pursuit direction. To test this possibility, we manipulated {FPA} activity and measured the effect on target selection behavior in rhesus monkeys. First, we unilaterally inactivated the {FPA} with the {GABA} agonist muscimol. We then measured the monkeys' performance on a pursuit-choice task. Second, we applied microstimulation unilaterally to the {FPA} during pursuit initiation while monkeys performed the same pursuit-choice task. Both of these manipulations produced significant effects on pursuit metrics; the inactivation decreased pursuit velocity and acceleration, and microstimulation evoked pursuit directly. Despite these changes, both manipulations failed to significantly alter choice behavior. These results show that {FPA} activity is not necessary for pursuit target selection.},

We asked whether this assumption holds true if the moving stimulus consists of a second-order motion stimulus. In addition, we asked whether neurons in area {MT} and {MST} code for moving sound sources. To answer these questions, we trained three rhesus monkeys on a direction-discrimination task. Our monkeys were able to correctly report the direction of all motion stimuli used in this study. Firing rates of directionally selective neurons from area {MT} (n = 38) and {MST} (n = 68) were recorded during task performance. These neurons coded only for the stimulus movement if the motion stimulus was separated from the background by luminance or flicker (Fourier and drift-balanced motion). If these segregation cues were absent (in the case of theta motion and of the moving sound source), firing rates did not code for the stimulus' direction. Therefore we conclude that although areas {MT} and {MST} are undoubtedly involved in processing a moving stimulus, they are not the final cortical stages responsible for perceiving it.},

In two experiments we used dual task paradigms to vary the attentional resources available for pursuit eye tracking. In both experiments we found that attentionally demanding secondary tasks impaired smooth pursuit performance, resulting in decreased velocity and increased position error. These findings suggest that attention is important for the maintenance of accurate smooth pursuit, and do not support the hypothesis that pursuit is a relatively automatic function that proceeds optimally in the absence of attentional control. These results add weight to the suggestion that a similar functional architecture underlies both pursuit and saccadic eye movements.},

In this study experiments were designed in which additional movement of most of the visual scene was applied during saccades. The subjects perceived the intrasaccadic movement after the saccade. The perceived speed of this movement was decreased and the threshold amplitude was increased compared to perception during fixation. The intrasaccadic movement perception was based on a novel aftereffect of motion perception. The velocity of retinal slip did not affect the threshold. If the retinal slip speed during saccades was temporally reduced by an intrasaccadic movement parallel to the saccade, the threshold amplitude was identical to the threshold amplitude obtained by intrasaccadic movement opposite to the saccade increasing retinal slip speed. Horizontal intrasaccadic movements were detected at lower thresholds than vertical movements independent of saccade direction. In addition, the thresholds were not effected by the saccade amplitude suggesting that neither speed, duration, nor direction of eye movement related retinal slip affects the amount of suppression.

	abstract = {Pursuit can be guided by perceived rather than physical motion, but the temporal relationship between motion perception and pursuit is unknown. We used an apparent motion stimulus consisting of a horizontal row of evenly spaced Kanizsa illusory squares (1.44 deg2): the illusory contours appeared at the midpoints of the illusory squares presented in the previous frame, producing bi-directional apparent motion of the illusory contours (21.5 deg/s) that could be reversed at will. We measured eye movements in five subjects asked to (1) track the motion of the illusory squares, and (2) reverse the perceived direction while continuing to track the squares. We measured the timing of the voluntary perceptual reversals and compared this to the time course of the reversal in tracking direction. We found that subjects could smoothly track the apparent motion of illusory squares and also produce saccade-free reversals in pursuit velocity. The time course of these motor reversals closely followed the measurements of the perceptual reversal and, on average, the perceptual reversals preceded the pursuit reversals by 53 ms, a delay shorter than when the perceptual reversal was visually guided. Smooth pursuit and the perception of motion direction were in temporal register and highly correlated, suggesting that pursuit can provide a real-time readout for the state of motion perception.},

Using functional brain imaging, we show that the level of ambiguity in choices correlates positively with activation in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex, and negatively with a striatal system. Moreover, striatal activity correlates positively with expected reward. Neurological subjects with orbitofrontal lesions were insensitive to the level of ambiguity and risk in behavioral choices.

	abstract = {In addition to their well-known role in skeletal movements, the basal ganglia control saccadic eye movements (saccades) by means of their connection to the superior colliculus ({SC}). The {SC} receives convergent inputs from cerebral cortical areas and the basal ganglia. To make a saccade to an object purposefully, appropriate signals must be selected out of the cortical inputs, in which the basal ganglia play a crucial role. This is done by the sustained inhibitory input from the substantia nigra pars reticulata ({SNr}) to the {SC}. This inhibition can be removed by another inhibition from the caudate nucleus ({CD}) to the {SNr}, which results in a disinhibition of the {SC}. The basal ganglia have another mechanism, involving the external segment of the globus pallidus and the subthalamic nucleus, with which the {SNr}-{SC} inhibition can further be enhanced. The sensorimotor signals carried by the basal ganglia neurons are strongly modulated depending on the behavioral context, which reflects working memory, expectation, and attention. Expectation of reward is a critical determinant in that the saccade that has been rewarded is facilitated subsequently. The interaction between cortical and dopaminergic inputs to {CD} neurons may underlie the behavioral adaptation toward purposeful saccades.},

We concentrate on six of these: the frontal eye field, parietal eye field, supplementary eye field, middle superior temporal area, prefrontal eye field, and area 7 m (precuneus in humans). In each of these regions: (1) there is neural activity closely related to eye movements; (2) electrical microstimulation produces or modifies eye movements; (3) surgical lesions or chemical inactivation impairs eye movements; (4) there are direct neural projections to major structures in the brainstem oculomotor system; and (5) increased activity is observed during eye movement tasks in functional magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography experiments in humans. Each of these eye fields is reciprocally connected with the other eye fields, and each receives visual information directly from visual association cortex. Each eye field has distinct subregions that are concerned with either saccadic or pursuit eye movements. The saccadic subregions are preferentially interconnected with other saccade subregions and the pursuit subregions are preferentially interconnected with other pursuit subregions. Current evidence strongly supports the proposal that there are parallel cortico-cortical networks that control purposeful saccadic and pursuit eye movements, and that the activity in those networks is modulated by feedback information, via the thalamus, from the superior colliculus, basal ganglia, and cerebellum.

For saccades programmed to a visual target this period is termed the dead time. Using a double-step paradigm, we examined potential variability in the dead time with variations in overall saccade latency and spatiotemporal configuration of two sequential targets. In experiment 1, we varied overall saccade latency by manipulating the presence or absence of a central fixation point. Despite a large and robust gap effect, decreasing the saccade latency in this way did not alter the dead time. In experiment 2, we varied the separation between the two targets. The dead time increased with separation up to a point and then leveled off. A stochastic accumulator model of the oculomotor decision mechanism accounts comprehensively for our findings. The model predicts a gap effect through changes in baseline activity without producing variations in the dead time. Variations in dead time with separation between the two target locations are a natural consequence of the population coding assumption in the model.},

Here we demonstrate in humans that saccade trajectories are disrupted by a reward-associated distractor even when participants expect this object, know where it may appear, and do their best to ignore it. The reward history of a visual object thus has a direct, low-level, and non-strategic influence on how we deploy our eyes.},

	abstract = {Positive outcome of actions can be maximized by choosing the option with the highest reward. For saccades, it has recently been suggested that the necessity to choose is, in fact, an important factor mediating reward effects: latencies to single low-reward targets increased with an increasing proportion of interleaved choice-trials, in which participants were free to choose between two targets to obtain either a high or low reward. Here, we replicate this finding for manual responses, demonstrating that this effect of choice is a more general, effector-independent phenomenon. Oscillatory activity in the alpha and beta band in the preparatory period preceding target onset was analysed for a parieto-occipital and a centrolateral region of interest to identify an anticipatory neural biasing mechanism related to visuospatial attention or motor preparation. When the proportion of interleaved choices was high, an increase in lateralized posterior alpha power indicated that the hemifield associated with a low reward was suppressed in preparation for reward-maximizing target selection. The larger the individual increase in lateralized alpha power, the slower the reaction times to low-reward targets. At a broader level, these findings support the notion that reward only affects responses when behaviour can be optimized to maximize positive outcome.},

Although exceptions to this rule have been reported [3-5], volitional control over smooth eye movements is at best rudimentary. Here, I introduce a novel, temporally modulated visual display, which, although static, sustains smooth eye movements in arbitrary directions. After brief training, participants gain volitional control over smooth pursuit eye movements and can generate digits, letters, words, or drawings at will.

In Expt 2, a counterbalanced sequence of inspection durations was completed in a single session. Total duration of the {MAE} and durations of the decay phase and tail were measured directly. The decay time constant ({DTC}), the time it takes for rated strength of the {MAE} to drop to 1/e of its initial value, was calculated from a line fit to a semilog plot of the ratings during the decay phase. The {DTC} is inversely related to the decay rate which is indexed by the slope of this line. In both experiments, the duration and {DTC} increased, and decay rate decreased, with increasing inspection duration for both rotary and linear {MAEs}. This finding replicates the results for linear {MAEs} and extends them to rotation {MAEs}. There were no discernible differences between the two types of {MAEs}. When the trials were spaced, the total duration increased with the square root of inspection duration. The {DTC} did not follow the square root rule over the entire range but appeared to approximate it for inspection durations of 90 sec and above.

	abstract = {If humans are faced with difficult choices when making decisions, the ability to slow down responses becomes critical in order to avoid suboptimal choices. Current models of decision making assume that the subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) mediates this function by elevating decision thresholds, thereby requiring more evidence to be accumulated before responding [1-9]. However, direct electrophysiological evidence for the exact role of {STN} during adjustment of decision thresholds is lacking. Here, we show that trial-by-trial variations in {STN} low-frequency oscillatory activity predict adjustments of decision thresholds before subjects make a response. The relationship between {STN} activity and decision thresholds critically depends on the subjects' level of cautiousness. While increased oscillatory activity of the {STN} predicts elevated decision thresholds during high levels of cautiousness, it predicts decreased decision thresholds during low levels of cautiousness. This context-dependent relationship may be mediated by increased influence of the medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC})-{STN} pathway on decision thresholds during high cautiousness. Subjects who exhibit a stronger increase in phase alignment of low-frequency oscillatory activity in {mPFC} and {STN} before making a response have higher decision thresholds and commit fewer erroneous responses. Together, our results demonstrate that {STN} low-frequency oscillatory activity and corresponding {mPFC}-{STN} coupling are involved in determining how much evidence subjects accumulate before making a decision. This finding might explain why deep-brain stimulation of the {STN} can impair subjects' ability to slow down responses and can induce impulsive suboptimal decisions.},

This meta-analysis of previous neuroimaging studies was performed to identify patterns of abnormal movement-related activation in {PD} that were consistent across studies. We applied activation likelihood estimation ({ALE}) of functional neuroimaging studies probing motor function in patients with {PD}. The meta-analysis encompassed data from 283 patients with {PD} reported in 24 functional neuroimaging studies and yielded consistent alterations in neural activity in patients with {PD}. Differences in cortical activation between {PD} patients and healthy controls converged in a left-lateralized fronto-parietal network comprising the presupplementary motor area, primary motor cortex, inferior parietal cortex, and superior parietal lobule. Both, increases as well as decreases in motor cortical activity, which were related to differences in movement timing and selection in the applied motor tasks, were reported in these cortical areas. In the basal ganglia, {PD} patients expressed a decrease of motor activation in the posterior motor putamen, which improved with dopaminergic medication. The likelihood of detecting a decrease in putaminal activity increased with motor impairment. This reduced motor activation of the posterior putamen across previous neuroimaging studies indicates that nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation affects neural processing in the denervated striatal motor territory. In contrast, fronto-parietal motor areas display both increases as well as decreases in movement related activation. This points to a more complex relationship between altered cortical physiology and nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation in {PD}.},

Using both our own and published data, we compared the effects of diffusive blur, dioptric blur, and eccentric viewing on contrast sensitivity for letter and grating targets. A diffuser placed close to the eye reduces contrast sensitivity fairly evenly across all spatial frequencies, with similar results for letters adn gratings. However, dioptric blur reduces sensitivity substrantially more to letters than to comparably fine gratings. Eccentric viewing also produces a larger sensitivity loss for letters than for gratings. Because some stimulus manipulations produced dissimilar changes in contrast sensitivity for letters and gratings, it is questionable whether the results of one measure can be used to draw inferences about the other. It is proposed that local or relative phase discrimination has an important role in explaining the different responses to letter and grating targets.},

	abstract = {Patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) have difficulties in the control of self-guided (i.e., internally driven) movements. The basal ganglia provide a nonspecific internal cue for the development of a preparatory activity for a given movement in the sequence of repetitive movements. Controversy surrounds the question of whether {PD} patients are capable of (1) anticipating (before an external trigger appears; i.e., anticipation) and (2) predicting movement velocity once a moving target shortly disappears from the visual scene (i.e., prediction). To dissociate between these two components, we examined internally driven (extraretinal generated) smooth pursuit eye movements in {PD} patients and age-matched healthy controls by systematically varying target blanking periods of a trapezoidally moving target in four paradigms (initial blanking, midramp blanking, blanking after a short ramp, and no blanking). Compared to controls, {PD} patients showed (1) decreased smooth pursuit gain (without blanking), (2) deficient anticipatory pursuit (prolonged pursuit initiation latency; reduced eye velocity before target onset in the early onset blanking paradigm), and (3) preserved extraretinal predictive pursuit velocity (midramp target blanking). Deficient anticipation of future target motion was not related to either disease duration or the general motor impairment ({UPDRS}). We conclude that {PD} patients have difficulties in anticipating future target motion, which may play a role for the mechanisms involved in deficient gait initiation and termination of {PD}. In contrast, they remain unimpaired in their capacity of building up an internal representation of continuous target motion. This may explain the clinical advantage of medical devices that use visual motion to improve gait initiation (e.g., "{PD} glasses"). © 2012 Movement Disorder Society.},

	abstract = {Summary From moment to moment, we perceive objects in the world as continuous despite fluctuations in their image properties due to factors like occlusion, visual noise, and eye movements. The mechanism by which the visual system accomplishes this object continuity remains elusive. Recent results have demonstrated that the perception of low-level stimulus features such as orientation and numerosity is systematically biased (i.e.; pulled) toward visual input from the recent past [1, 2]. The spatial region over which current orientations are pulled by previous orientations is known as the continuity field, which is temporally tuned for the past 10-15 s [1]. This perceptual pull could contribute to the visual stability of low-level features over short time periods, but it does not address how visual stability occurs at the level of object identity. Here, we tested whether the visual system facilitates stable perception by biasing current perception of a face, a complex and behaviorally relevant object, toward recently seen faces. We found that perception of face identity is systematically biased toward identities seen up to several seconds prior, even across changes in viewpoint. This effect did not depend on subjects' prior responses or on the method used to measure identity perception. Although this bias in perceived identity manifests as a misperception, it is adaptive: visual processing echoes the stability of objects in the world to create perceptual continuity. The serial dependence of identity perception promotes object identity invariance over time and provides the clearest evidence for the existence of an object-selective perceptual continuity field.},

The activated regions were consistent with the neural circuitry hypothesized to underlie somatic marker activation and decision-making.

Here we ask how sensory signals within a saccade area are influenced by selecting and preparing a saccade. Trained monkeys made or withheld saccades, based on a color cue, to targets varying in luminance contrast. We measured the initial visual activity of superior colliculus ({SC}) neurons in response to the appearance of these targets. We determined neuronal contrast responses in three task conditions: when two luminance gratings appeared one in the response field ({RF}) and one in the mirror-opposite location and a cue to select the stimulus in the {RF} occurred; when the gratings appeared and a cue to select the stimulus out of the {RF} occurred; and third, when the gratings appeared but monkeys remained fixating on the central spot. {SC} neurons had increases in visual responses when contrast increased. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed an increased ability of neurons to detect the grating on trials with higher contrast targets and also on trials with a cue to make a saccade compared with trials with a cue to remain fixating. Using two measures of neuronal sensitivity, those {SC} neurons considered part of the motor circuitry increased their sensitivity to contrast with a cue to make a saccade. The results indicate that movement commands influence sensory responses in {SC} in much the same way that commands to shift attention influence sensory responses in extrastriate cortex.},

	abstract = {Studies in patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) suggest that the characteristic motor symptoms of the disorder are frequently accompanied by impairments in cognition that are most profound in tasks of executive function. Neuropsychological deficits are not an inevitable consequence of the disease, yet the reasons underlying cognitive heterogeneity in {PD} are not well understood. To determine the underlying neural correlate of these cognitive deficits, we used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to compare groups of cognitively impaired and unimpaired patients, matched on all other clinical measures. {fMRI} revealed significant signal intensity reductions during a working-memory paradigm in specific striatal and frontal lobe sites in patients with cognitive impairment compared with those patients who were not cognitively unimpaired. These results demonstrate that cognitive deficits in {PD} are accompanied by neural changes that are related to, but distinct from, those changes that underlie motoric deficits in these patients. Furthermore, they suggest that {fMRI} may provide a valuable tool for identifying patients who may benefit from targeted therapeutic strategies.},

These impairments are most pronounced in situations in which reward is uncertain (e.g., probabilistic reward schedules) and if outcome information is ambiguous (e.g., the relative value of outcomes has to be learned). Furthermore, whereas children show a greater sensitivity to external outcome information, older adults focus less on a rapid differentiation of rewarding outcomes. In this article, we review evidence for the idea that these phenomenologically similar impairments in learning and outcome monitoring in children and older adults can be attributed to deficits in different underlying neurophysiological mechanisms. We propose that in older adults learning impairments are the result of reduced dopaminergic projections to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which lead to less differentiated representations of reward value. In contrast, in children, impairments in learning can be primarily attributed to deficits in executive control, which may be due to a protracted development of the dorsal medial and lateral prefrontal cortices. We think that this framework maps well onto recent neurophysiological models of reward processing and is plausible from a broader developmental perspective.},

	abstract = {The problem of maintaining independence between response rates and reinforcement probabilities when determining the effect of varying the response-reinforcement contingency upon free-operant behavior was solved by programming local reinforcement probabilities for response and no response on a second-by-second basis. Fifty-seven rats were trained to lever-press on schedules of water reinforcement involving different values of contingency. All rats were first trained on a high positive contingency and then shifted to less positive, zero, or negative contingencies. Under these conditions, rate of lever-pressing declined appropriately when the contingency between response and reinforcement decreased or was made negative. The decline in rate produced by a zero contingency cannot be attributed to extinction, since the probability of reinforcement given the occurrence of a response was the same as for the positive contingency from which the shift to zero was made. That is, there was no change in the opportunity for response-reinforcement contiguity. It was concluded that the technique of programming local reinforcement probabilities offers promise for more critical examinations of the effects of contingency upon free-operant behavior.},

The {FRN} and the behavioral indicators of learning were measured in a sample of 44 children, 45 adolescents, 46 younger adults, and 44 older adults. The amplitude of the {FRN} after gains and losses was found to decrease monotonically from childhood to old age. Furthermore, relative to adolescents and younger adults, both children and older adults (a) showed smaller differences between the {FRN} after losses and the {FRN} after gains, indicating a less differentiated classification of outcomes on the basis of task-specific goals; (b) needed more trials to learn from choice outcomes, particularly when differences in reward likelihood between the choices were small; and (c) learned less from gains than from losses.

Yet dopamine is also a key modulator of motivation, invigorating current behavior. Existing theories propose that fast (phasic) dopamine fluctuations support learning, whereas much slower (tonic) dopamine changes are involved in motivation. We examined dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens across multiple time scales, using complementary microdialysis and voltammetric methods during adaptive decision-making. We found that minute-by-minute dopamine levels covaried with reward rate and motivational vigor. Second-by-second dopamine release encoded an estimate of temporally discounted future reward (a value function). Changing dopamine immediately altered willingness to work and reinforced preceding action choices by encoding temporal-difference reward prediction errors. Our results indicate that dopamine conveys a single, rapidly evolving decision variable, the available reward for investment of effort, which is employed for both learning and motivational functions.},

	abstract = {Suppose that the purpose of a movement is to place the body in a more rewarding state. In this framework, slower movements may increase accuracy and therefore improve the probability of acquiring reward, but the longer durations of slow movements produce devaluation of reward. Here we hypothesize that the brain decides the vigor of a movement (duration and velocity) based on the expected discounted reward associated with that movement. We begin by showing that durations of saccades of varying amplitude can be accurately predicted by a model in which motor commands maximize expected discounted reward. This result suggests that reward is temporally discounted even in timescales of tens of milliseconds. One interpretation of temporal discounting is that the true objective of the brain is to maximize the rate of reward-which is equivalent to a specific form of hyperbolic discounting. A consequence of this idea is that the vigor of saccades should change as one alters the intertrial intervals between movements. We find experimentally that in healthy humans, as intertrial intervals are varied, saccade peak velocities and durations change on a trial-by-trial basis precisely as predicted by a model in which the objective is to maximize the rate of reward. Our results are inconsistent with theories in which reward is discounted exponentially. We suggest that there exists a single cost, rate of reward, which provides a unifying principle that may govern control of movements in timescales of milliseconds, as well as decision making in timescales of seconds to years.},

	abstract = {Visually guided eye movements are driven by a mix of current signals (e.g. visual motion) and prior experience (predictive strategies). Previously, large ablations of the frontal eye field ({FEF}) impaired visually guided smooth pursuit. This study examined if the pursuit decrement could be laid to a selective loss in predictive signals. Normal monkeys demonstrated some of the same predictive eye movements documented in humans. They pursued periodic visual targets with near-zero phase lag. When such targets suddenly disappeared, the monkeys continued smooth pursuit without visual guidance for several reaction times. These epochs of 'blind pursuit' achieved a peak velocity proportional to the prior target frequency just experienced by the monkey. With predictable step-ramp targets smooth eye movements sometimes preceded target motion (anticipatory pursuit). Reaction time to begin pursuit was influenced by the target velocity of prior trials. Small unilateral ablations of 'low threshold' {FEF} slowed smooth pursuit if the fundus of the arcuate sulcus was thoroughly removed. On the step-ramp targets the slowing was evident in both the initial 100 ms and subsequent portions of pursuit. During sine pursuit blind epochs were more slowed by surgery than were visually guided epochs of pursuit. Ipsilateral anticipatory pursuit was abolished in one subject, but not in the other subject with pursuit deficits. Otherwise, pursuit after surgery continued to display the influence of predictive strategies. The average phase lag of periodic pursuit remained much than the pursuit system's reaction time. Blind epochs persisted after the periodic target disappeared, albeit with a lower peak velocity. Reaction time to begin pursuit of step-ramp targets remained a function of the monkey's experience on prior trials. It is argued that the {FEF} pursuit deficits do not reflect the loss of visual motion signals of the loss of some 'cognitive' signal such as a prediction about the target's motion, but rather can be explained as a motor deficit. © 1993 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

In addition, humans are equipped with the ability to rotate the eye ball continuously in a highly predicting manner (smooth pursuit) to hold a moving target steadily upon the retina. The functional deficits in neurodegenerative movement disorders (e.g., Parkinsonian syndromes) involve the basal ganglia that are critical in all aspects of movement control. Moreover, neocortical structures, the cerebellum, and the midbrain may become affected by the pathological process. A broad spectrum of eye movement alterations may result, comprising smooth pursuit disturbance (e.g., interrupting saccades), saccadic dysfunction (e.g., hypometric saccades), and abnormal attempted fixation (e.g., pathological nystagmus and square wave jerks). On clinical grounds, videooculography is a sensitive noninvasive in vivo technique to classify oculomotion function alterations. Eye movements are a valuable window into the integrity of central nervous system structures and their changes in defined neurodegenerative conditions, that is, the oculomotor nuclei in the brainstem together with their directly activating supranuclear centers and the basal ganglia as well as cortical areas of higher cognitive control of attention.},

We tested the hypothesis that {STSA} reflects the working of a cerebellar mechanism needed to avoid 'fatigue', a gradual drop in saccade amplitude during a long series of stereotypic saccades. To this end we compared the kinematics of saccades of 14 patients suffering from different forms of cerebellar disease with those of controls in two tests of {STSA} and a test of saccadic resilience. Controls showed an increase in saccade amplitude ({SA}) for outward adaptation, prompted by outward target shifts, due to an increase in saccade duration ({SD}) in the face of constant peak velocity ({PV}). The decrease in {SA} due to inward adaptation was, contrariwise, accompanied by a drop in {PV} and {SD}. Whereas patients with intact vermis did not differ from controls, those with vermal pathology lacked outward adaptation: {SD} remained constant, as did {SA} and {PV}. In contrast, vermal patients demonstrated a significant decrease in {SA}, paralleled by a decrease in {PV} but mostly unaltered {SD} in the inward adaptation experiment as well as in the resilience test. These findings support the notion that inward adaptation is at least partially based on uncompensated fatigue. On the other hand, outward adaptation reflects an active mechanism for the compensation of fatigue, residing in the cerebellum.},

Saccadic parameters and occurrences of square wave jerks did not differ between subjects with {PD} and controls.

	abstract = {Over the past two decades significant progress has been made toward understanding the neural basis of primate decision making, the biological process that combines sensory data with stored information to select and execute behavioral responses. The most striking progress in this area has been made in studies of visual-saccadic decision making, a system that is becoming a model for understanding decision making in general. In this system, theoretical models of efficient decision making developed in the social sciences are beginning to be used to describe the computations the brain must perform when it connects sensation and action. Guided in part by these economic models, neurophysiologists have been able to describe neuronal activity recorded from the brains of awake-behaving primates during actual decision making. These recent studies have examined the neural basis of decisions, ranging from those made in predictable sensorimotor tasks to those unpredictable decisions made when animals are engaged in strategic conflict. All of these experiments seem to describe a surprisingly well-integrated set of physiological mechanisms that can account for a broad range of behavioral phenomena. This review presents many of these recent studies within the emerging neuroeconomic framework for understanding primate decision making.},

We compared 19 patients with early-onset {PD} (/= 45 years) on dopaminergic medication (no evidence of depression, dementia, executive dysfunction according to the Tower of London test and the Stroop test, or pathological gambling) with 20 age-matched controls. A computer version of the {IGT} was employed. The {PD} patients achieved slightly lower {IGT} scores than the control group. A detailed analysis based on 'shift frequencies' between the individual decks showed that the patients tended to change their preferences for the decks more frequently, with a higher preference for the 'disadvantageous' deck B. Control subjects seemed to develop a more effective strategy. These differences could be caused by the poorer ability of the patients to develop any strategy at all. We observed changes in decision making during {IGT} performance in patients with early-onset {PD}, although they had no executive dysfunction as measured by established neuropsychological tests. The more detailed analysis employed in the present study could lead to a more accurate study of {IGT} performance and application of {IGT} in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Our animal studies suggest that the basal ganglia provide an internal non-specific cue to trigger movement and imply that Parkinson's disease involves a deficiency in this cueing mechanism. Indeed parkinsonian patients typically rely upon external visual cues. To assess the effects of such non-specific cueing mechanisms on movement, we examined patients' utilization of a variety of auditory cues. Ten patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, and their matched controls, pressed buttons at a series of two-way choice points sequentially down a pathway, both when the latter remained illuminated throughout its length, and when it had to be followed from memory alone. In other experimental conditions, auditory cues were also provided, either contingent upon the previous response, at its initiation (a medium level of advance information) or at its completion (a low level of advance information), or as a series of regularly paced (non-contingent) auditory cues (from a metronome). In addition to error data, we recorded down time ({DT}, time to initiate each next response) and movement time ({MT}, time to execute each next response). However, both {DT} and {MT} measurements showed that parkinsonian patients were enormously disadvantaged by the absence of external cues. While contingent auditory cues were of some help, the performance of patients with Parkinson's disease was dramatically improved by the provision of non-contingent auditory information. Moreover, parkinsonian patients, unlike controls, were greatly affected by the length of individual sub-movements, especially in the absence of external cues. When the pathway to be followed remained illuminated, sub-movement length had little effect. We conclude that for well-learnt, predictable sequences the basal ganglia provide a non-specific internal cue that is necessary for switching between one movement and the next in a movement sequence, and also for development of preparatory activity for each sub-movement in the sequence.},

	abstract = {Humans are able to use knowledge of previous events to estimate the probability of future actions. Consequently, an unexpected event will elicit a prediction error as the prepared action has to be replaced by an unprepared option in a process known as “action reprogramming” ({AR}). Here we show that people with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) have a dopamine-sensitive deficit in {AR} that is proportional to the size of the prediction error. Participants performed a probabilistic reaction time ({RT}) task in the context of either a predictable or unpredictable environment. For an overall predictable sequence, {PD} patients, on and off dopamine medication, and healthy controls showed similar improvements in {RT}. However, in the context of a generally predictable sequence, {PD} patients off medication were impaired in reacting to unexpected events that elicit large prediction errors and require {AR}. Critically, this deficit in {AR} was modulated by the prediction error associated with the upcoming event. The prolongation of {RT} was not observed during an overall unpredictable sequence, in which relatively unexpected events evoke little prediction error and the requirement for {AR} should be minimal, given the context. The data are compatible with recent theoretical accounts suggesting that levels of dopamine encode the reliability, i.e., precision, of sensory information. In this scheme, {PD} patients off medication have low dopamine levels and may therefore be less confident about incoming sensory information and more reliant on top-down predictions. Consequently, when these internal predictions are incorrect, {PD} patients take longer to respond appropriately to unexpected sensory information.},

	abstract = {Both the frontal eye fields ({FEFs}) and supplementary eye fields ({SEFs}) are known to be involved in smooth pursuit eye movements. It has been shown recently that stimulation of the smooth-pursuit area of the {FEF} [frontal pursuit area ({FPA})] in monkey increases the pursuit response to unexpected changes in target motion during pursuit. In the current study, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) to the {FPA} and {SEF} in humans during sinusoidal pursuit to assess its effects on the pursuit response to predictable, rather than unexpected, changes in target motion. For the {FPA}, we found that {TMS} applied immediately before the target reversed direction increased eye velocity in the new direction, whereas {TMS} applied in mid-cycle, immediately before the target began to slow, decreased eye velocity. For the {SEF}, {TMS} applied at target reversal increased eye velocity in the new direction but had no effect on eye velocity when applied at mid-cycle. {TMS} of the control region (leg region of the somatosensory cortex) did not affect eye velocity at either point. Previous stimulation studies of {FPA} during pursuit have suggested that this region is involved in controlling the gain of the transformation of visual signals into pursuit motor commands. The current results suggest that the gain of the transformation of predictive signals into motor commands is also controlled by the {FPA}. The effect of stimulation of the {SEF} is distinct from that of the {FPA} and suggests that its role in sinusoidal pursuit is primarily at the target direction reversal.},

	abstract = {Recently, we examined the neuronal substrate of predictive pursuit during memory-based smooth pursuit and found that supplementary eye fields ({SEFs}) contain signals coding assessment and memory of visual motion direction, decision not-to-pursue ("no-go"), and preparation for pursuit. To determine whether these signals were unique to the {SEF}, we examined the discharge of 185 task-related neurons in the caudal frontal eye fields ({FEFs}) in 2 macaques. Visual motion memory and no-go signals were also present in the caudal {FEF} but compared with those in the {SEF}, the percentage of neurons coding these signals was significantly lower. In particular, unlike {SEF} neurons, directional visual motion responses of caudal {FEF} neurons decayed exponentially. In contrast, the percentage of neurons coding directional pursuit eye movements was significantly higher in the caudal {FEF} than in the {SEF}. Unlike {SEF} inactivation, muscimol injection into the caudal {FEF} did not induce direction errors or no-go errors but decreased eye velocity during pursuit causing an inability to compensate for the response delays during sinusoidal pursuit. These results indicate significant differences between the 2 regions in the signals represented and in the effects of chemical inactivation suggesting that the caudal {FEF} is primarily involved in generating motor commands for smooth-pursuit eye movements.},

To{\textbackslash}nmaintain the target image on the fovea during smooth{\textbackslash}ngaze tracking, and to compensate for the long delays{\textbackslash}ninvolved in processing visual motion information and/or{\textbackslash}neye velocity commands, the pursuit system must use{\textbackslash}nprediction. We have shown recently that both retinal{\textbackslash}nimage-slip-velocity and gaze-velocity signals are coded{\textbackslash}nin the discharge of single pursuit-related neurons in{\textbackslash}nthe simian periarcuate cortex. To understand how{\textbackslash}nperiarcuate pursuit neurons are involved in predictive{\textbackslash}nsmooth pursuit, we examined the discharge{\textbackslash}ncharacteristics of these neurons in trained Japanese{\textbackslash}nmacaques. When a stationary target abruptly moved{\textbackslash}nsinusoidally along the preferred direction at 0.5 Hz,{\textbackslash}nthe response delays of pursuit cells seen at the onset{\textbackslash}nof target motion were compensated in succeeding cycles.{\textbackslash}{nThe} monkeys were also required to continue smooth{\textbackslash}npursuit of a sinusoidally moving target while it was{\textbackslash}nblanked for about half of a cycle at 0.5 Hz. This{\textbackslash}nblanking was applied before cell activity normally{\textbackslash}nincreased and before the target changed direction.{\textbackslash}{nNormalized} mean gain of the cells' responses (re{\textbackslash}ncontrol value without blanking) decreased to{\textbackslash}n0.81(+/-0.67 {SD}), whereas normalized mean gain of the{\textbackslash}neye movement (eye gain) decreased to 0.65 (+/-0.16 {SD}).{\textbackslash}{nA} majority (75\%) of pursuit neurons discharged{\textbackslash}nappropriately up to 500 ms after target blanking even{\textbackslash}nthough eye velocity decreased sharply, suggesting a{\textbackslash}ndissociation of the activity of those pursuit neurons{\textbackslash}nand eye velocity. To examine whether pursuit cell{\textbackslash}nresponses contain a predictive component that{\textbackslash}nanticipates visual input, the monkeys were required to{\textbackslash}nfixate a stationary target while a second test laser{\textbackslash}nspot was moved sinusoidally. A majority (68\%) of{\textbackslash}npursuit cells tested responded to the second target{\textbackslash}nmotion. When the second spot moved abruptly along the{\textbackslash}npreferred direction, the response delays clearly seen{\textbackslash}nat the onset of sinusoidal target motion were{\textbackslash}ncompensated in succeeding cycles.

Similar{\textbackslash}nresponses were also evoked even if the second spot was{\textbackslash}nflashed as it moved. Since the monkeys fixated the{\textbackslash}nstationary spot well, such flashed stimuli should not{\textbackslash}ninduce significant retinal slip. These results taken{\textbackslash}ntogether suggest that the prediction-related activity{\textbackslash}nof periarcuate pursuit neurons contains extracted{\textbackslash}nvisual components that reflect direction and speed of{\textbackslash}nthe reconstructed target image, signals sufficient for{\textbackslash}nestimating target motion.

	abstract = {While retinal image motion is the primary input for smooth-pursuit, its efficiency depends on cognitive processes including prediction. Reports are conflicting on impaired prediction during pursuit in Parkinson's disease. By separating two major components of prediction (image motion direction memory and movement preparation) using a memory-based pursuit task, and by comparing tracking eye movements with those during a simple ramp-pursuit task that did not require visual memory, we examined smooth-pursuit in 25 patients with Parkinson's disease and compared the results with 14 age-matched controls. In the memory-based pursuit task, cue 1 indicated visual motion direction, whereas cue 2 instructed the subjects to prepare to pursue or not to pursue. Based on the cue-information memory, subjects were asked to pursue the correct spot from two oppositely moving spots or not to pursue. In 24/25 patients, the cue-information memory was normal, but movement preparation and execution were impaired. Specifically, unlike controls, most of the patients (18/24 = 75\%) lacked initial pursuit during the memory task and started tracking the correct spot by saccades. Conversely, during simple ramp-pursuit, most patients (83\%) exhibited initial pursuit. Popping-out of the correct spot motion during memory-based pursuit was ineffective for enhancing initial pursuit. The results were similar irrespective of levodopa/dopamine agonist medication. Our results indicate that the extra-retinal mechanisms of most patients are dysfunctional in initiating memory-based (not simple ramp) pursuit. A dysfunctional pursuit loop between frontal eye fields ({FEF}) and basal ganglia may contribute to the impairment of extra-retinal mechanisms, resulting in deficient pursuit commands from the {FEF} to brainstem.

	abstract = {Smooth-pursuit eye movements allow primates to track moving objects. Efficient pursuit requires appropriate target selection and predictive compensation for inherent processing delays. Prediction depends on expectation of future object motion, storage of motion information and use of extra-retinal mechanisms in addition to visual feedback. We present behavioral evidence of how cognitive processes are involved in predictive pursuit in normal humans and then describe neuronal responses in monkeys and behavioral responses in patients using a new technique to test these cognitive controls. The new technique examines the neural substrate of working memory and movement preparation for predictive pursuit by using a memory-based task in macaque monkeys trained to pursue (go) or not pursue (no-go) according to a go/no-go cue, in a direction based on memory of a previously presented visual motion display. Single-unit task-related neuronal activity was examined in medial superior temporal cortex ({MST}), supplementary eye fields ({SEF}), caudal frontal eye fields ({FEF}), cerebellar dorsal vermis lobules {VI}-{VII}, caudal fastigial nuclei ({cFN}), and floccular region. Neuronal activity reflecting working memory of visual motion direction and go/no-go selection was found predominantly in {SEF}, cerebellar dorsal vermis and {cFN}, whereas movement preparation related signals were found predominantly in caudal {FEF} and the same cerebellar areas. Chemical inactivation produced effects consistent with differences in signals represented in each area. When applied to patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD}), the task revealed deficits in movement preparation but not working memory. In contrast, patients with frontal cortical or cerebellar dysfunction had high error rates, suggesting impaired working memory. We show how neuronal activity may be explained by models of retinal and extra-retinal interaction in target selection and predictive control and thus aid understanding of underlying pathophysiology.},

	abstract = {Smooth pursuit and vestibularly induced eye movements interact to maintain the accuracy of eye movements in space (i.e., gaze). To understand the role played by the frontal eye fields in pursuit-vestibular interactions, we examined activity of 110 neurons in the periarcuate areas of head-stabilized Japanese monkeys during pursuit eye movements and passive whole-body rotation. The majority (92\%) responded with the peak of their modulation near peak stimulus velocity during suppression of the vestibuloocular reflex ({VOR}) when the monkeys tracked a target that moved with the same amplitude and phase and in the same plane as the chair. We classified pursuit-related neurons (n = 100) as gaze- velocity if their peak modulation occurred for eye (pursuit) and head ({VOR} suppression) movements in the same direction; the amplitude of modulation during one less than twice that of the other; and modulation was lower during target-stationary-in-space condition ({VOR} x1) than during {VOR} suppression. In addition, we examined responses during {VOR} enhancement (x2) in which the target moved with equal amplitude as, but opposite direction to, the chair. Gaze-velocity neurons responded maximally for opposite directions during {VOR} x2 and suppression. Based on these criteria, the majority of pursuit-related neurons (66\%) were classified as gaze-velocity with preferred directions uniformly distributed. Because the majority of the remaining cells (32/34) also responded during {VOR} suppression, they were classified as eye/head-velocity neurons. Thirteen preferred pursuit and {VOR} suppression in the same direction; 13 in the opposite direction, and 6 showed biphasic modulation during {VOR} suppression. Eye- and gaze-velocity sensitivity of the two groups of cells were similar; mean (+/- {SD}) was 0.53 +/- 0.30 and 0.50 +/- 0.44 spikes/s per degrees /s, respectively. Gaze-velocity (but not eye/head-velocity) neurons showed significant correlation between eye- and gaze-velocity sensitivity, and both groups maintained their responses when the tracking target was extinguished briefly. The majority of pursuit-related neurons (28/43 = about 65\%) responded to chair rotation in complete darkness. When the monkeys fixated a stationary target, more than half of cells tested (21/40) discharged in proportion to the velocity of retinal motion of a second laser spot (mean velocity sensitivity = 0.20 +/- 0.16 spikes/s per degrees /s). Preferred directions of individual cells to the second spot were similar to those during pursuit. Visual responses to the second spot movement were maintained even when it was extinguished briefly. These results indicate that both retinal image- and gaze-velocity signals are carried by single periarcuate pursuit-related neurons, suggesting that these signals can provide target-velocity-in-space and gaze-velocity commands during pursuit-vestibular interactions.},

The authors tested 44 older adults with a probabilistic selection task sensitive to dopaminergic function and designed to assess relative biases to learn more from positive or negative feedback. Previous studies demonstrated that low levels of dopamine lead to avoidance of those choices that lead to negative outcomes, whereas high levels of dopamine result in an increased sensitivity to positive outcomes. In the current study, age had a significant effect on the bias to avoid negative outcomes: Older seniors showed an enhanced tendency to learn from negative compared with positive consequences of their decisions. Younger seniors failed to show this negative learning bias. Moreover, the enhanced probabilistic integration of negative outcomes in older seniors was accompanied by a reduction in trial-to-trial learning from positive outcomes, thought to rely on working memory. These findings are consistent with models positing multiple neural mechanisms that support probabilistic integration and trial-to-trial behavior, which may be differentially impacted by older age.},

	abstract = {Dopamine ({DA}) depletion in the basal ganglia ({BG}) of Parkinson's patients gives rise to both frontal-like and implicit learning impairments. Dopaminergic medication alleviates some cognitive deficits but impairs those that depend on intact areas of the {BG}, apparently due to {DA} ''overdose.'' These findings are difficult to accommodate with verbal theories of {BG}/{DA} function, owing to complexity of system dynamics: {DA} dynamically modulates function in the {BG}, which is itself a modulatory system. This article presents a neural network model that instantiates key biological properties and provides insight into the underlying role of {DA} in the {BG} during learning and execution of cognitive tasks. Specifically, the {BG} modulates the execution of ''actions'' (e.g., motor different parts of the frontal cortex. Phasic changes in {DA}, which occur during error feedback, dynamically modulate the {BG} threshold for facilitating/suppressing a cortical command in response to particular stimuli. Reduced dynamic range of {DA} explains Parkinson and {DA} overdose deficits with a single underlying dysfunction, despite overall differences in raw {DA} levels. Simulated Parkinsonism and medication effects provide a theoretical basis for behavioral data in probabilistic classification and reversal tasks. The model also provides novel testable predictions for neuropsychological and pharmacological studies, and motivates further investigation of {BG}/{DA} interactions with the prefrontal cortex in working memory.},

Patients with Parkinson's disease, who have depleted dopamine in the basal ganglia, are impaired in tasks that require learning from trial and error. Here, we show, using two cognitive procedural learning tasks, that Parkinson's patients off medication are better at learning to avoid choices that lead to negative outcomes than they are at learning from positive outcomes. Dopamine medication reverses this bias, making patients more sensitive to positive than negative outcomes. This pattern was predicted by our biologically based computational model of basal ganglia-dopamine interactions in cognition, which has separate pathways for "Go" and "{NoGo}" responses that are differentially modulated by positive and negative reinforcement.},

	abstract = {Summary From moment to moment, we perceive objects in the world as continuous despite fluctuations in their image properties due to factors like occlusion, visual noise, and eye movements. The mechanism by which the visual system accomplishes this object continuity remains elusive. Recent results have demonstrated that the perception of low-level stimulus features such as orientation and numerosity is systematically biased (i.e.; pulled) toward visual input from the recent past [1, 2]. The spatial region over which current orientations are pulled by previous orientations is known as the continuity field, which is temporally tuned for the past 10-15 s [1]. This perceptual pull could contribute to the visual stability of low-level features over short time periods, but it does not address how visual stability occurs at the level of object identity. Here, we tested whether the visual system facilitates stable perception by biasing current perception of a face, a complex and behaviorally relevant object, toward recently seen faces. We found that perception of face identity is systematically biased toward identities seen up to several seconds prior, even across changes in viewpoint. This effect did not depend on subjects' prior responses or on the method used to measure identity perception. Although this bias in perceived identity manifests as a misperception, it is adaptive: visual processing echoes the stability of objects in the world to create perceptual continuity. The serial dependence of identity perception promotes object identity invariance over time and provides the clearest evidence for the existence of an object-selective perceptual continuity field.},

	abstract = {During active vision, the eyes continually scan the visual environment using saccadic scanning movements. This target article presents an information processing model for the control of these movements, with some close parallels to established physiological processes in the oculomotor system. Two separate pathways are concerned with the spatial and the temporal programming of the movement. In the temporal pathway there is spatially distributed coding and the saccade target is selected from a "salience map." Both pathways descend through a hierarchy of levels, the lower ones operating automatically. Visual onsets have automatic access to the eye control system via the lower levels. Various centres in each pathway are interconnected via reciprocal inhibition. The model accounts for a number of well-established phenomena in target-elicited saccades: the gap effect, express saccades, the remote distractor effect, and the global effect. High-level control of the pathways in tasks such as visual search and reading is discussed; it operates through spatial selection and search selection, which generally combine in an automated way. The model is examined in relation to data from patients with unilateral neglect.},

	abstract = {Two rhesus monkeys were trained to track a small moving target in the presence of a moving distractor. The target and distractor were distinguished by their color. Smooth pursuit eye movements were quantified in terms of the latency of the eye movement and the open-loop eye acceleration profile. Smooth pursuit latencies for single targets were on the order of 100 msec. When the target was paired with a distractor moving in the same direction as the target, pursuit latencies decreased to roughly 85 msec. When the target was paired with a distractor moving in the opposite direction, pursuit latencies increased to roughly 150 msec. The motion of the distractor had no significant effect on the eye acceleration profile. Experiments were performed to dissociate visual search for the target from pursuit initiation by providing a spatial cue rather than the color cue. These experiments showed that visual search necessarily preceded pursuit initiation only when the distractor moved in the opposite direction relative to the target. In this case, visual search contributed about 25 msec to the overall latency of pursuit. Control experiments showed that the monkey need not attend to the distractor in order for it to influence the latency of pursuit. A network model was developed in which units that represent the motions of the target and distractor compete against one another. Attention serves to bias the outcome of this competition toward the direction of the selected target. The performance of this network exhibits a striking parallel to the effect of the distractor on smooth pursuit latency.},

In contrast, in a later evaluation process, associated with memory updating and indexed by the P300, both age groups preferably processed unexpected positive feedback. However, younger adults additionally differentiated between unexpected negative and expected feedback while older adults did not, probably due to a lower working memory capacity. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

There is also conflicting evidence regarding the role of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLF}) in this task. The present study examined whether poor performance on the {IGT} was specific for {VMF} damage and whether fundamental impairments in reversal learning contributed to {IGT} performance. We found that both {VMF} and {DLF} damage leads to impaired {IGT} performance.

They describe 3 experiments, based on mean group responses, indicating that the perceived randomness of a sequence is better predicted by various measures of its encoding difficulty than by its objective randomness. These results seem to imply that in accordance with the complexity view, judging the extent of a sequence's randomness is based on an attempt to mentally encode it.

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate an ocular motor role for the {STN} in Parkinson's disease ({PD}) patients. Methods: Potentials were recorded from deep brain stimulation ({DBS}) electrodes implanted in the vicinity of {STN} in five {PD} patients, while patients simultaneously performed visually cued saccades, self-paced saccades and in two patients self-paced wrist extensions. Results: Premovement potentials related to visually cued saccades were found in 4/5 patients and 56\% (5/9) of potentials showed phase reversal indicating a local generator. Onsets of these potentials began closer to saccade initiation from {STN} contacts (0.88 ± 0.30 s) than thalamic ones (1.39 ± 0.28 s). Self-paced saccade-related potentials were found in 4/4 patients. Self-paced saccade potential onsets (1.82 ± 0.88 s) were not different from self-paced wrist extension onsets (1.27 ± 0.98 s), suggesting a non-specific mechanism could be responsible for both potentials. 50\% (3/6) of potentials to self-paced saccades and 66\% (2/3) of potentials to self-paced wrist extensions showed phase reversal. Potentials could be found either ipsilaterally or contralaterally with respect to saccade direction. Conclusions: These subcortical premovement potentials to saccades are similar to Bereitschaftspotentials and contingent negative variations to limb movements recorded in cortical and subcortical regions. Significance: These studies further support a role of {STN} in ocular motor control and suggest a common mechanism of motor preparation for both eye and limb movements in the basal ganglia. © 2006 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.},

	abstract = {Visual attention enables us to selectively prioritize or suppress information in the environment. Prominent models concerned with the control of visual attention differ-entiate between goal-directed, top-down and stimulus-driven, bottom-up control, with the former determined by current se-lection goals and the latter determined by physical salience. In the current review, we discuss recent studies that demonstrate that attentional selection does not need to be the result of top-down or bottom-up processing but, instead, is often driven by lingering biases due to the Bhistory{\textasciicircum} of former attention de-ployments. This review mainly focuses on reward-based his-tory effects; yet other types of history effects such as (intertrial) priming, statistical learning and affective condition-ing are also discussed. We argue that evidence from behavior-al, eye-movement and neuroimaging studies supports the idea that selection history modulates the topographical landscape of spatial Bpriority{\textasciicircum} maps, such that attention is biased toward locations having the highest activation on this map. In everyday life, visual input is used to guide our behavior. We intentionally search for our bag on the luggage carousel at the airport while keeping in mind its shape and color to facilitate search. This template makes it easier to find our bag among the many distracting similarly looking bags. When searching with a goal for particular objects, we may sometimes experience that we attend to things in our environment for which we had no intention to look for. We may inadvertently attend to the waving hand of our friend who already found his bag or the flashing light next to yet another luggage carousel that is about to start moving. The question for how we search the environment, and more generally how we parse information from the environment, is studied in the context of attentional control. All models of selective attention have described attentional control as the result of the above described interplay between voluntary, top-down, or goal-driven control and automatic, bottom-up, or stimulus driven control (e.g., Corbetta \& Shulman, 2002; Itti \& Koch, 2001; Theeuwes, 2010). In a recent paper, Awh, Belopolsky, and Theeuwes (2012) pointed out that this classic theoretical dichotomy may no longer hold as there is a signif-icant explanatory gap: Several selection biases can neither be explained by current selection goals nor by the physical sa-lience of potential targets. Awh et al. suggested that a third category labelled as selection history competes for selection. This category describes lingering selection biases formed by the history of attentional deployments that are unrelated to top-down goals or the physical salience of items. The current review takes the previous paper of Awh et al. (2012) further and discusses recent findings of key behavioral, eye-movement, and neuroimaging studies that demonstrate effects that should be considered to be the result of selection history (i.e., lingering selection biases based on history). While focusing on reward-based history effects, other history effects such as (intertrial) priming, affective conditioning and statistical learning are also discussed. In the following sec-tions, we will first briefly introduce some of the critical con-cepts around (selective) attention and review the recent surge in literature investigating how attention is affected by reward (history) as well as other types of selection history, before we embed the findings into the bigger picture of how selection},

	abstract = {Decision-making impairments in Parkinson's disease ({PD}) are most likely associated with dysfunctions in fronto-striatal loops. Recent studies examined decision-making in {PD} either in ambiguous situations with implicit rules, using the Iowa Gambling Task ({IGT}), or in risky situations with explicit rules, using the Game of Dice Task ({GDT}). Both tasks have been associated with the limbic-orbitofrontal-striatal loop, involved in emotional processing. However, the {GDT} has additionally been highly associated with the dorsolateral prefrontal-striatal loop, being involved in executive functions. The present study is the first one which examined decision-making in {PD} patients with both, {IGT} and {GDT}. We studied 21 non-demented {PD} patients on dopaminergic medication and 23 healthy controls with both tasks and a neuropsychological test battery with focus on executive functions. To analyse possible abnormalities in emotional processing, electrodermal responses ({EDRs}) were assessed while performing the tasks. We found that {PD} patients were significantly impaired in the {GDT}, but not in the {IGT}. Executive dysfunctions correlated with {GDT} but not with {IGT} performance. In both tasks, {PD} patients showed significantly reduced feedback {EDRs} after losses, but not after gains, indicating a primary decline of sensitivity to negative feedback. Our behavioural data suggest that dysfunctions in the dorsolateral prefrontal loop might be stronger than in the limbic loop, resulting in deficits in executive functions and {GDT} performance but unimpaired {IGT} performance. Reduced sensitivity to negative feedback is discussed with regard to dysfunctions in the limbic loop, which may result from pathology of limbic structures or dopaminergic medication. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the current literature to highlight relations between age-associated declines in dopaminergic and serotonergic neuromodulation and adult age differences in adaptive goal-directed behavior. Specifically, we focus on evidence suggesting that deficits in neuromodulation contribute to older adults' behavioral disadvantages in learning and decision making. These deficits are particularly pronounced when reward information is uncertain or the task context requires flexible adaptations to changing stimulus-reward contingencies. Moreover, emerging evidence points to age-related differences in the sensitivity to rewarding and aversive outcomes during learning and decision making if the acquisition of behavior critically depends on outcome processing. These age-related asymmetries in outcome valuation may be explained by age differences in the interplay of dopaminergic and serotonergic neuromodulation. This hypothesis is based on recent neurocomputational and psychopharmacological approaches, which suggest that dopamine and serotonin serve opponent roles in regulating the balance between approach behavior and inhibitory control. Studying adaptive regulation of behavior across the adult life span may shed new light on how the aging brain changes functionally in response to its diminishing resources.},

We were interested in whether the electrophysiological correlates of error processing, the error-related negativity ({ERN}) and the feedback-related negativity ({FRN}), reflect learning-related changes in younger and older adults. To do so, we applied a probabilistic learning task in which we manipulated the validity of feedback. The results of our study showed that learning-related changes were much more pronounced (a) in a response-locked positivity for correct trials compared to the {ERN} and (b) in a feedback-locked positivity for positive feedback compared to the {FRN}. These findings provide an important extension to recent theoretical accounts [Holroyd, C. B., \& Coles, M. G. H. (2002).

Cognitive, Affective and Behavioral Neuroscience, 2, 19-36] since they suggest that positive learning signals on correct trials contribute to the reward-related variance in the response- and feedback-locked {ERPs}. This effect has been overlooked in previous studies that have focused on the role of errors and negative feedback for learning. Importantly, we did not find evidence for an age-related reduction of the {ERN}, when controlling for performance differences between age groups, which questions the view that older adults are generally impaired in error processing. Finally, we observed a substantial reduction of the {FRN} in the elderly, which indicates that older adults are less affected by negative feedback and rely more on positive feedback during learning. This finding points to an age-related asymmetry in the processing of feedback valence. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here we investigate the modulation of microsaccades by shifts of covert attention in a classical spatial cueing paradigm. First, we replicate the suppression of microsaccades with a minimum rate about 150 ms after cue onset. Second, as a new finding we observe microsaccadic enhancement with a maximum rate about 350 ms after presentation of the cue. Third, we find a modulation of the orientation towards the cue direction. These multiple influences of visual attention on microsaccades accentuate their role for visual information processing. Furthermore, our results suggest that microsaccades can be used to map the orientation of visual attention in psychophysical experiments. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We applied a feedback-based learning task with two learning conditions. In the positive learning condition, participants could learn to choose responses that lead to monetary gains, whereas in the negative learning condition, they could learn to avoid responses that lead to monetary losses. To test the stability of learning preferences, the task involved a reversal phase in which stimulus--response assignments were inverted. Negative learners were defined as individuals that performed better in the negative than in the positive learning condition (and vice versa for positive learners). The behavioral data showed strong individual differences in learning from positive and negative outcomes that persisted throughout the reversal phase and were more pronounced for older than younger adults. Older negative learners showed a stronger tendency to avoid negative outcomes than younger negative learners. However, contrary to younger adults, this negative learning bias was not associated with a larger {ERN}, suggesting that avoidance learning in older negative learners might be decoupled from error processing. Furthermore, older adults showed learning impairments compared to younger adults.

	abstract = {Anticipatory pursuit is not exclusively based on the recent history of target motion ("temporal anticipation"): it can also use static visual cues ("non-temporal anticipation"). Large non-temporal anticipatory changes of the direction of smooth pursuit are observed when the future trajectory of the target can be inferred from a visual "path cue" (Ladda et al. Exp Brain Res 182:343-356, 2007). It is not known whether these anticipatory responses can be considered an example of volitional pursuit or whether a more automatic, fast mechanism exists that associates the visual shape of the path cue with a future change of target motion. We therefore compared anticipatory direction changes induced by path cues with those induced by more symbolic visual cues. Further, we measured the processing time of path cues by keeping them ambiguous until 300 ms before the target entered the curve. The cues became unambiguous either when a missing part of the path cue suddenly appeared or when a misleading (invalid) path cue disappeared. Five main results suggest that the non-temporal smooth pursuit anticipation induced by path cues is due to a particular visual processing of the cue, rather than to a general volitional smooth pursuit component: (1) A curved static band providing detailed spatial information about the target's trajectory was much more efficient than more symbolic visual cues. (2) The latency for processing the path cue was less than 200 ms. (3) The effect of the path cue did not depend on a visual transient in the retinal periphery. (4) It critically depended on the spatial relation between path cue and target trajectory. (5) The anticipatory response decreased, but was still highly significant when the path cue was non-informative with respect to the future target trajectory. These findings indicate that anticipatory modifications of ongoing pursuit do not rely exclusively on the processing of motion signals, but can directly interact with low-level processes analyzing background structures.},

	abstract = {The prefrontal cortex is made up of neocortical areas thought to mediate aspects of the temporal and spatial organization of behavior. One of the prime output targets of the prefrontal cortex is the striatum, which is thought to operate in series with the prefrontal cortex in some neural computations. We have analyzed this prefronto-striatal projection in cynomolgus monkeys by combining anterograde neuronal tract tracing methods with neurochemical markers for the striosome and matrix compartments of the striatum. Our results single out two parts of the frontal cortex as projecting densely to the striosome compartment of the striatum: the posterior orbitofrontal/anterior insular cortex and the mediofrontal prelimbic/anterior cingulate cortex. These areas jointly innervated striosomes in the anterior and ventromedial striatum, mainly in the caudate nucleus. Striosomes in the dorsolateral striatum were never labeled. Thus, the anatomical subsystem defined by striosome affiliation includes three cortical and striatal regions that, in humans, have been implicated in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Nearly all of the remaining parts of the prefrontal cortex studied projected preferentially to the matrix compartment. Most of these prefrontal inputs were also patchy, and many of the patches (matrisomes) were selectively paired with nearby striosomes. The highly fractionated organization of prefrontal inputs to striosomes and matrisomes could form a template for computational networks in the striatum that redistribute prefrontal corticostriatal inputs to serve in context-dependent behavioral planning.},

Oxford University Press, New York, pp. 217-229]) proposes that emotion-based biasing signals arising from the body are integrated in higher brain regions, in particular the ventromedial prefrontal cortex ({VMPFC}), to regulate decision-making in situations of complexity. Evidence for the {SMH} is largely based on performance on the Iowa Gambling Task ({IGT}; [Bechara, A., Tranel, D., Damasio, H., Damasio, A.R., 1996. Failure to respond autonomically to anticipated future outcomes following damage to prefrontal cortex. Cerebral Cortex 6 (2), 215-225]), linking anticipatory skin conductance responses ({SCRs}) to successful performance on a decision-making paradigm in healthy participants. These 'marker' signals were absent in patients with {VMPFC} lesions and were associated with poorer {IGT} performance. The current article reviews the {IGT} findings, arguing that their interpretation is undermined by the cognitive penetrability of the reward/punishment schedule, ambiguity surrounding interpretation of the psychophysiological data, and a shortage of causal evidence linking peripheral feedback to {IGT} performance. Further, there are other well-specified and parsimonious explanations that can equally well account for the {IGT} data. Next, lesion, neuroimaging, and psychopharmacology data evaluating the proposed neural substrate underpinning the {SMH} are reviewed. Finally, conceptual reservations about the novelty, parsimony and specification of the {SMH} are raised. It is concluded that while presenting an elegant theory of how emotion influences decision-making, the {SMH} requires additional empirical support to remain tenable. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The eye movement system is sensitive to reward. However, whilst the eye movement system is extremely flexible, the extent to which changes to oculomotor behavior induced by reward paradigms persist beyond the training period or transfer to other oculomotor tasks is unclear. To address these issues we examined the effects of presenting feedback that represented small monetary rewards to spatial locations on the latency of saccadic eye movements, the time-course of learning and extinction of the effects of rewarding saccades on exogenous spatial attention and oculomotor inhibition of return. Reward feedback produced a relative facilitation of saccadic latency in a stimulus driven saccade task which persisted for three blocks of extinction trials. However, this hemifield-specific effect failed to transfer to peripheral cueing tasks. We conclude that rewarding specific spatial locations is unlikely to induce long-term, systemic changes to the human oculomotor or attention systems.},

	abstract = {The role of different parts of the human retina in eliciting optokinetic pursuit was investigated with continuously moving random dot or grid patterns (dia up to 30 °). The retinal location and velocity of the stimulus could be fixed by servo control of the stimulus position by the eye position, and artificial scotomata could be inserted into the stimulus. Under these conditions (opened optokinetic feedback loop) pursuit velocity became much larger than the stimulus velocity. With a central stimulus, pursuit velocity (gain) in the 8 principal directions showed individual, but no systematic differences. In the periphery, a centrifugal stimulus movement was much more effective than a centripetal movement. This directional preference may assist foveation. Pursuit open-loop gain was only moderately diminished by a decrease of the stimulus diameter, but much more severely by deleting small parts in the centre. This indicates that the fovea is more powerful than the periphery in eliciting optokinetic pursuit. The distribution of fast and slow nystagmic phases with respect to the primary position was unaffected by the use of open-loop conditions or central scotomata. For all peripheral stimuli, the responses were strongly enhanced by the subject's specific attention. © 1979.},

	abstract = {The dopamine system, which plays a crucial role in reward processing, is particularly vulnerable to aging. Significant losses over a normal lifespan have been reported for dopamine receptors and transporters, but very little is known about the neurofunctional consequences of this age-related dopaminergic decline. In animals, a substantial body of data indicates that dopamine activity in the midbrain is tightly associated with reward processing. In humans, although indirect evidence from pharmacological and clinical studies also supports such an association, there has been no direct demonstration of a link between midbrain dopamine and reward-related neural response. Moreover, there are no in vivo data for alterations in this relationship in older humans. Here, by using 6-[(18)F]{FluoroDOPA} ({FDOPA}) positron emission tomography ({PET}) and event-related 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) in the same subjects, we directly demonstrate a link between midbrain dopamine synthesis and reward-related prefrontal activity in humans, show that healthy aging induces functional alterations in the reward system, and identify an age-related change in the direction of the relationship (from a positive to a negative correlation) between midbrain dopamine synthesis and prefrontal activity. These results indicate an age-dependent dopaminergic tuning mechanism for cortical reward processing and provide system-level information about alteration of a key neural circuit in healthy aging. Taken together, our findings provide an important characterization of the interactions between midbrain dopamine function and the reward system in healthy young humans and older subjects, and identify the changes in this regulatory circuit that accompany aging.},

Here I consider computational factors that can affect decision making and review anatomical structures and neurochemical systems that are related to contextual modulation of decision making. Expectation of a high reward can motivate a subject to go for an action despite a large cost, a decision that is influenced by dopamine in the anterior cingulate cortex. Uncertainty of action outcomes can promote risk taking and exploratory choices, in which norepinephrine and the orbitofrontal cortex appear to be involved. Predictable environments should facilitate consideration of longer-delayed rewards, which depends on serotonin in the dorsal striatum and dorsal prefrontal cortex. This article aims to sort out factors that affect the process of decision making from the viewpoint of reinforcement learning theory and to bridge between such computational needs and their neurophysiological substrates.},

	abstract = {Influence of previous visual stimulus or saccade on saccadic reaction times in monkey. Saccadic reaction times ({SRTs}) to suddenly appearing targets are influenced by neural processes that occur before and after target presentation. The majority of previous studies have focused on how posttarget factors, such as target attributes or changes in task complexity, affect {SRTs}. Studies of pretarget factors have focused on how prior knowledge of the timing or location of the impending target, gathered through cueing or probabilistic information, affects {SRTs}. Our goal was to investigate additional pretarget factors to determine whether {SRTs} can also be influenced by the history of saccadic and visual activity even when these factors are spatially unpredictive as to the location of impending saccadic targets. Monkeys were trained on two paradigms. In the saccade-saccade paradigm, monkeys were required to follow a saccadic target that stepped from a central location, to an eccentric location, back to center, and finally to a second eccentric location. The stimulus-saccade paradigm was similar, except the central fixation target remained illuminated during presentation of the first eccentric stimulus; the monkey was required to maintain central fixation and to make a saccade to the second eccentric stimulus only on disappearance of the fixation point. In both paradigms, the first eccentric stimulus was presented at the same, opposite, or orthogonal location with respect to the final target location in a given trial. We measured {SRTs} to the final target under conditions in which all parameters were identical except for the location of the first eccentric stimulus. In the saccade-saccade paradigm, we found that the {SRT} to the final target was slowest when it was presented opposite to the initial saccadic target, whereas in the stimulus-saccade paradigm the {SRT} to the final target was slowest when it was presented at the same location as the initial stimulus. In both paradigms, these increases in {SRTs} were greatest during the shortest intervals between presentation of successive eccentric stimuli, yet these effects remained present for the longest intervals employed in this study. {SRTs} became faster as the direction and eccentricity of the two successive stimuli became increasingly misaligned from that which produced the maximal {SRT} slowing in each paradigm. The results of the stimulus-saccade paradigm are similar to the phenomenon of inhibition of return ({IOR}) in which human subjects are slower to respond to stimuli that are presented at previously cued locations. We interpret these findings in terms of overlapping representations of visuospatial and oculomotor activity in the same neural structures.},

For the purposes of this discussion the pursuit may be called adequate when it is sufficiently accurate to permit clear vision. Whenever the line of regard lags behind or overshoots the moving object, vision became more or less blurred and the pursuit may be called inadequate. Determination of the degree of adequacy with which normal eyes pursue at various velocities of the visual object seems important, not only to provide a base line for the study of abnormalities, but also for an understanding of the mechanism},

To test whether different reward information is represented in the {FEF} and the basal ganglia, we recorded from the {FEF} and the caudate nucleus in monkeys performing an asymmetrically rewarded memory-guided saccade task. A peripheral cue at one of two opposing positions was flashed briefly to indicate the saccade target. In a given block, one position was associated with big reward and the other with small reward. Big-reward position was alternated between blocks. In this task, the {FEF} and caudate displayed similar prevalence of neuronal activity before cue onset that was larger in blocks with specific big reward-cue position associations. They also exhibit comparable reward modulation of visual responses that were spatially selective. In contrast, visual responses that were specific to expected reward size, instead of spatial locations, were commonly observed in caudate but rarely seen in the {FEF}. Thus, both the {FEF} and basal ganglia may contribute to reward bias in saccade generation, with the {FEF} providing spatially relevant reward information and the basal ganglia providing additional reward-specific information.},

	abstract = {Inferring on others' (potentially time-varying) intentions is a fundamental problem during many social transactions. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we applied computational modeling to behavioral data from an economic game in which 16 pairs of volunteers (randomly assigned to "player" or "adviser" roles) interacted. The player performed a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, receiving information about a binary lottery from a visual pie chart. The adviser, who received more predictive information, issued an additional recommendation. Critically, the game was structured such that the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied in time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, we found that the players' behavior was best explained by the deployment of hierarchical learning: they inferred upon the volatility of the advisers' intentions in order to optimize their predictions about the validity of their advice. Beyond learning, volatility estimates also affected the trial-by-trial variability of decisions: participants were more likely to rely on their estimates of advice accuracy for making choices when they believed that the adviser's intentions were presently stable. Finally, our model of the players' inference predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index ({IRI}) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. Overall, our results suggest that humans (i) employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others, (ii) use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and (iii) integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework presented here can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms from simple behavioral readouts and may prove useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition.},

	abstract = {Anticipatory eye movements are often evoked by the temporal expectation of an upcoming event. Temporal expectation is based on implicit timing about when a future event could occur. Implicit timing emerges from observed temporal regularities in a changing stimulus without any voluntary estimate of elapsed time, unlike explicit timing. The neural bases of explicit and implicit timing are likely different. It has been shown that the basal ganglia ({BG}) play a central role in explicit timing. In order to determine the influence of {BG} in implicit timing, we investigated the influence of early Parkinson's disease ({PD}) and aging on the latency of anticipatory eye movements. We hypothesized that a deficit of implicit timing should yield inadequate temporal expectations, and consequently abnormally timed anticipatory eye movements compared with age-matched controls. To test this hypothesis, we used an oculomotor paradigm where anticipation of a salient target event plays a central role. Participants pursued a visual target that moved along a circular path at a constant velocity. After a randomly short (1200. ms) or long (2400. ms) forward path, the target reversed direction, returned to its starting position and stopped. Target motion reversal caused an abrupt 'slip' of the pursued target image on the retina and was a particularly salient event evoking anticipatory eye movements. Anticipatory eye movements were less frequent in {PD} patients. However, the timing of anticipation of target motion reversal was statistically similar in {PD} patients and control subjects. Other eye movements showed statistically significant differences between {PD} and controls, but these differences could be attributed to other factors. We conclude that all anticipatory eye movements are not similarly impaired in {PD} and that implicit timing of salient events seems largely unaffected by this disease. The results support the hypothesis that implicit and explicit timing are differently affected by {BG} dysfunction. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The purpose of this paper was to investigate quantitatively the catch-up saccades occurring during sustained pursuit. We used a ramp-step-ramp paradigm to evoke catch-up saccades during sustained pursuit. In general, catch-up saccades followed the unexpected steps in position and velocity of the target. We observed catch-up saccades in the same direction as the smooth eye movement (forward saccades) as well as in the opposite direction (reverse saccades). We made a comparison of the main sequences of forward saccades, reverse saccades, and control saccades made to stationary targets. They were all three significantly different from each other and were fully compatible with the hypothesis that the smooth pursuit component is added to the saccadic component during catch-up saccades. A multiple linear regression analysis was performed on the saccadic component to find the parameters determining the amplitude of catch-up saccades. We found that both position error and retinal slip are taken into account in catch-up saccade programming to predict the future trajectory of the moving target. We also demonstrated that the saccadic system needs a minimum period of approximately 90 ms for taking into account changes in target trajectory. Finally, we reported a saturation (above 15 degrees /s) in the contribution of retinal slip to the amplitude of catch-up saccades.},

	abstract = {Serotonin is a neuromodulator that is extensively entangled in fundamental aspects of brain function and behavior. We present a computational view of its involvement in the control of appetitively and aversively motivated actions. We first describe a range of its effects in invertebrates, endowing specific structurally fixed networks with plasticity at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We then consider its rather widespread distribution in the mammalian brain. We argue that this is associated with a more unified representational and functional role in aversive processing that is amenable to computational analyses with the kinds of reinforcement learning techniques that have helped elucidate dopamine's role in appetitive behavior. Finally, we suggest that it is only a partial reflection of dopamine because of essential asymmetries between the natural statistics of rewards and punishments.},

	abstract = {The timing of an upcoming event depends on two factors: its temporal position, proximal or distal with respect to the present moment, and the unavoidable stochastic variability around this temporal position. We searched for a general mechanism that could describe how these two factors influence the anticipation of an upcoming event in an oculomotor task. Monkeys were trained to pursue a moving target with their eyes. During a delay period inserted before target motion onset, anticipatory pursuit responses were frequently observed. We found that anticipatory movements were altered by the temporal position of the target. Increasing the timing uncertainty associated with the stimulus resulted in an increase in the width of the latency distribution of anticipatory pursuit. These results show that monkeys relied on an estimation of the changing probability of target motion onset as time elapsed during the delay to decide when to initiate an anticipatory smooth eye movement.},

	abstract = {1. Humans may visually track a moving object either when they are stationary or in motion. To investigate visual-vestibular interaction during both conditions, we compared horizontal smooth pursuit ({SP}) and active combined eye-head tracking ({CEHT}) of a target moving sinusoidally at 0.4 Hz in four normal subjects while the subjects were either stationary or vibrated in yaw at 2.8 Hz. We also measured the visually enhanced vestibuloocular reflex ({VVOR}) during vibration in yaw at 2.8 Hz over a peak head velocity range of 5–40 degrees/s. 2. We found that the gain of the {VVOR} at 2.8 Hz increased in all four subjects as peak head velocity increased (P \&lt; 0.001), with minimal phase changes, such that mean retinal image slip was held below 5 degrees/s. However, no corresponding modulation in vestibuloocular reflex gain occurred with increasing peak head velocity during a control condition when subjects were rotated in darkness. 3. During both horizontal {SP} and {CEHT}, tracking gains were similar, and the mean slip speed of the targets image on the retina was held below 5.5 degrees/s whether subjects were stationary or being vibrated at 2.8 Hz. During both horizontal {SP} and {CEHT} of target motion at 0.4 Hz, while subjects were vibrated in yaw, {VVOR} gain for the 2.8-Hz head rotations was similar to or higher than that achieved during fixation of a stationary target. This is in contrast to the decrease of {VVOR} gain that is reported while stationary subjects perform {CEHT}.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

However, movements have many properties, such as their trajectories, speeds and timing of end-points, thus the brain needs to decide which properties of movements should be improved; it needs to solve the credit assignment problem. Currently, little is known about how humans solve credit assignment problems in the context of reinforcement learning. Here we tested how human participants solve such problems during a trajectory-learning task. Without an explicitly-defined target movement, participants made hand reaches and received monetary rewards as feedback on a trial-by-trial basis. The curvature and direction of the attempted reach trajectories determined the monetary rewards received in a manner that can be manipulated experimentally. Based on the history of action-reward pairs, participants quickly solved the credit assignment problem and learned the implicit payoff function. A Bayesian credit-assignment model with built-in forgetting accurately predicts their trial-by-trial learning.},

Assuming unity feedback, the open-loop transfer function was also computed for both of the above inputs. It is shown that the anticipatory behaviors observed during the tracking of periodic inputs, can be attributed to a prediction operator. This operator is determined by comparing the open-loop transfer functions for both stimuli.

Parkinson's disease ({PD}) provides a model to assess their implications in humans. The aims of the study were to investigate motivation and sensitivity to reinforcement in non-demented and -depressed {PD} patients and to evaluate the influence of dopaminergic therapy by comparing patients in "on" (with L-Dopa) and "off" (without L-Dopa) states. Twenty-three {PD} patients were compared, in both the "on" and "off" states, to 28 controls, using: (1) an Apathy Scale; (2) Stimulus-Reward Learning, Reversal, and Extinction tasks; and (3) a Gambling task. {PD} patients were found: (1) mildly apathetic; (2) impaired on Stimulus-Reward Learning and Reversal, but not on Extinction; and (3) able to progress in the Gambling task during the first, but not the second assessment. There was no significant correlation between these various deficits. L-Dopa treatment clearly improved motivation, but had more limited and contrasting effects on other variables, decreasing the number of omission errors in Reversal, but increasing the number of perseveration errors in Extinction. These results suggest: (1) an implication of striatofrontal loops in human motivation and explicit and implicit sensitivity to reinforcement; (2) a positive influence of L-Dopa treatment on the subjective evaluation of motivation, but contrasting effects on reward sensitivity. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {Attention can be used to keep track of moving items, particularly when there are multiple targets of interest that cannot all be followed with eye movements. Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) was used to investigate cortical regions involved in attentive tracking. Cortical flattening techniques facilitated within-subject comparisons of activation produced by attentive tracking, visual motion, discrete attention shifts, and eye movements. In the main task, subjects viewed a display of nine green "bouncing balls" and used attention to mentally track a subset of them while fixating. At the start of each attentive-tracking condition, several target balls (e.g., 3/9) turned red for 2 s and then reverted to green. Subjects then used attention to keep track of the previously indicated targets, which were otherwise indistinguishable from the nontargets. Attentive-tracking conditions alternated with passive viewing of the same display when no targets had been indicated. Subjects were pretested with an eye-movement monitor to ensure they could perform the task accurately while fixating. For seven subjects, functional activation was superimposed on each individual's cortically unfolded surface. Comparisons between attentive tracking and passive viewing revealed bilateral activation in parietal cortex (intraparietal sulcus, postcentral sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and precuneus), frontal cortex (frontal eye fields and precentral sulcus), and the {MT} complex (including motion-selective areas {MT} and {MST}). Attentional enhancement was absent in early visual areas and weak in the {MT} complex. However, in parietal and frontal areas, the signal change produced by the moving stimuli was more than doubled when items were tracked attentively. Comparisons between attentive tracking and attention shifting revealed essentially identical activation patterns that differed only in the magnitude of activation. This suggests that parietal cortex is involved not only in discrete shifts of attention between objects at different spatial locations but also in continuous "attentional pursuit" of moving objects. Attentive-tracking activation patterns were also similar, though not identical, to those produced by eye movements. Taken together, these results suggest that attentive tracking is mediated by a network of areas that includes parietal and frontal regions responsible for attention shifts and eye movements and the {MT} complex, thought to be responsible for motion perception. These results are consistent with theoretical models of attentive tracking as an attentional process that assigns spatial tags to targets and registers changes in their position, generating a high-level percept of apparent motion.},

Once visual feedback is available, however, it is difficult to distinguish {ASP} from the visually-driven response with which it merges. Here we have developed a paradigm that extends the anticipatory period to show unequivocally how {ASP} can evolve over periods of up to 600 ms before being influenced by visual feedback. {ASP} was evoked by repeated presentation of constant velocity (ramp) stimuli preceded by auditory cues. The target was occluded during the initial part of the ramp, so that when it became visible it had already moved to an eccentric position. The occlusion period (T occ) varied from 0 to 500 ms in 100 ms increments; for each period ramps were presented in blocks of 8 with velocity held constant at 8, 16, 24 or 32 degrees/s. Eye displacement trajectories showed that subjects attempted to match the unseen target trajectory with a mixture of saccades and smooth pursuit. The smooth component was initiated progressively earlier in relation to target appearance as T occ increased, leading to progressively higher {ASP} gains by the time the target became visible. This prolongation of {ASP} throughout the occlusion period reveals the underlying internal drive that produces it, a drive that under normal circumstances quickly becomes masked by visual feedback.},

	abstract = {To examine the role of three cortical eye fields during internally guided decision-making processes, we recorded neuronal activities in the frontal eye field ({FEF}), supplementary eye field ({SEF}), and lateral intraparietal cortex ({LIP}) using a free-choice delayed saccade task with two synchronized targets. Although the monkeys must perform the task in a time-locked manner, they were free to choose either the receptive field ({RF}) target or the nonreceptive field ({nRF}) target to receive reward. In all three areas we found neurons with stronger activation during trials when the monkey was going to make a saccade to the {RF} target ({RF} trials) than to the {nRF} target ({nRF} trials). Modulation occurred not only during target presentation (visual bias) but also before target presentation (anticipatory bias). The visual bias was evident as an attenuated visual response to the {RF} stimulus in {nRF} trials. The anticipatory bias, however, was seen as an enhancement of pretarget activity in the {RF} trials. We analyzed the activity during the 500 msec before target presentation and found that 22.5\% of {FEF} and 31.3\% of {LIP} neurons and 49.1\% of {SEF} neurons showed higher activity during the {RF} trials. To more accurately determine when each neuron started to show preferential activity, we used a new inverse interspike interval analysis procedure. Our results suggest that although all three cortical eye fields reflect attentional and intentional aspects of sensorimotor processing, {SEF} plays an earlier and perhaps more cognitive role in internally guided decision-making processes for saccades.},

	volume = {87},
	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {In previous experiments, on-line modulation of the gain of visual-motor transmission for pursuit eye movements was demonstrated in monkeys by showing that the response to a brief perturbation of target motion was strongly enhanced during pursuit relative to during fixation. The present paper elaborates the properties of on-line gain control by recording the smooth-pursuit eye movements of human subjects during tracking of a spot target. When perturbations consisted of one cycle of a 5-Hz sine wave, responses were significantly larger during pursuit than during fixation. Furthermore, responses grew as a function of eye/target velocity at the time of the perturbation and of perturbation amplitude. Thus human pursuit, like monkey pursuit, is modulated by on-line gain control. For larger perturbations consisting of a single sine wave at 2.8 Hz, +/-19 degrees/s, the degree of enhancement depended strongly on the phase of the perturbation. Enhancement was present when "peak-first" perturbations caused the target speed to increase first and was attenuated when "peak-last" perturbations caused target speed to decrease first. This effect was most profound when the perturbation was 2.8 Hz, +/-19 degrees/s but was also present when the amplitude of the peak-last perturbation was +/-5 degrees/s. For peak-last perturbations, the eye velocity evoked by the later peak of the perturbation was inversely related to that evoked by the preceding trough of the perturbation. We interpret these effects of perturbation phase as evidence that peak-last perturbations cause a decrease in the on-line gain of visual-motor transmission for pursuit. We conclude that gain control is modulated dynamically as behavioral conditions change. Finally, when perturbations were presented as a sequence of three large, peak-last sine waves starting at the onset of target motion at 10 degrees /s, repeating the conditions used in prior studies on humans, we were able to replicate the prior finding that the response to the perturbations was equal during pursuit and fixation. We conclude that on-line gain control modulates human pursuit and that it can be probed most reliably with small, brief perturbations that do not affect the on-line gain themselves.},

	abstract = {Past studies have shown that reward contingency is critical for sensorimotor learning, and reward expectation speeds up saccades in animals. Whether monetary reward speeds up saccades in human remains unknown. Here we addressed this issue by employing a conditional saccade task, in which human subjects performed a series of non-reflexive, visually-guided horizontal saccades. The subjects were (or were not) financially compensated for making a saccade in response to a centrally-displayed visual congruent (or incongruent) stimulus. Reward modulation of saccadic velocities was quantified independently of the amplitude-velocity coupling. We found that reward expectation significantly sped up voluntary saccades up to 30 °/s, and the reward modulation was consistent across tests. These findings suggest that monetary reward speeds up saccades in human in a fashion analogous to how juice reward sped up saccades in monkeys. We further noticed that the idiosyncratic nasal-temporal velocity asymmetry was highly consistent regardless of test order, and its magnitude was not correlated with the magnitude of reward modulation. This suggests that reward modulation and the intrinsic velocity asymmetry may be governed by separate mechanisms that regulate saccade generation.},

In Experiment 1, outcomes were either neutral or were associated with point gain. In Experiment 2, subjects were administered different outcome treatments: neutral outcomes, outcomes associated with money gain, or outcomes associated with money loss. In both experiments, subjects' judgments of response-outcome contingency and their operant responses were each strong linear functions of ΔP, the difference between the probability of an outcome given a response and the probability of an outcome given no response. Appetitive and aversive outcomes produced opposite and symmetrical response patterns. In Experiment 1, no differences in ratings occurred with neutral or appetitive outcomes; however, in Experiment 2, more potent appetitve outcomes led to somewhat more extreme ratings than either neutral or aversive outcomes. Increasing outcome probability produced only a slight bias in ratings of noncontingent problems in Experiment 1 and no bias in Experiment 2. Contrary to predictions derived from an analysis of superstitious behavior, increasing outcome probability in noncontingent problems decreased operant responding when outcomes were appetitive and increased operant responding when outcomes were aversive. Trend analyses revealed that Δ P was superior to several other metrics in predicting subjects' estimates of contingency and the behavioral effects of contingency. Operant responding was in closer accord with matching predictions than with maximizing predictions. © 1985.},

	abstract = {Ballistic movements like saccades require the brain to generate motor commands without the benefit of sensory feedback. Despite this, saccades are remarkably accurate. Theory suggests that this accuracy arises because the brain relies on an internal forward model that monitors the motor commands, predicts their sensory consequences, and corrects eye trajectory midflight. If control of saccades relies on a forward model, then the forward model should adapt whenever its predictions fail to match sensory feedback at the end of the movement. Using optimal feedback control theory, we predicted how this adaptation should alter saccade trajectories. We trained subjects on a paradigm in which the horizontal target jumped vertically during the saccade. With training, the final position of the saccade moved toward the second target. However, saccades became increasingly curved, i.e., suboptimal, as oculomotor commands were corrected on-line to steer the eye toward the second target. The adaptive response had two components: (1) the motor commands that initiated the saccades changed slowly, aiming the saccade closer to the jumped target. The adaptation of these earliest motor commands displayed little forgetting during the rest periods. (2) Late in saccade trajectory, another adaptive response steered it still closer to the jumped target, producing curvature. Adaptation of these late motor commands showed near-complete forgetting during the rest periods. The two components adapted at different timescales, with the late-acting component displaying much faster rates. It appears that in controlling saccades, the brain relies on an internal feedback that has the characteristics of a fast-adapting forward model.},

	abstract = {In contrast to their slowed limb movements, individuals with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) produce rapid automatic eye movements to sensory stimuli and show an impaired ability to generate voluntary eye movements in cognitive tasks. Eighteen {PD} patients and 18 matched control volunteers were instructed to look either toward (pro-saccade) or away from (anti-saccade) a peripheral stimulus as soon as it appeared (immediate, gap and overlap conditions) or after a variable delay; or, they made sequential saccades to remembered targets after a variable delay. We found that {PD} patients made more express saccades (correct saccades in the latency range of 90-140 ms) in the immediate pro-saccade task, more direction errors (automatic pro-saccades) in the immediate anti-saccade task, and were less able to inhibit saccades during the delay period in all delay tasks. {PD} patients also made more directional and end-point errors in the memory-guided sequential task. Their inability to plan eye movements to remembered target locations suggests that {PD} patients have a deficit in spatial working memory which, along with their deficit in automatic saccade suppression, is consistent with a disorder of the prefrontal-basal ganglia circuit. Impairment of this pathway may release the automatic saccade system from top-down inhibition and produce deficits in volitional saccade control. Parallel findings across various motor, cognitive and oculomotor tasks suggest a common mechanism underlying a general deficit in automatic response suppression. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We confirmed the supposed deficit of decision-making in {AN}. However, restricting and binge eating/purge subtypes showed different patterns of decision-making impairment. Poor performance on the Gambling task is not a mere consequence of starvation and does not appear to be related to illness severity.

Results indicate that approach behaviors (operationalized as the tendency to play increasingly from the advantageous decks over the course of the task) display an inverted U-shape relation to age, peaking in mid- to late adolescence. In contrast, avoidance behaviors (operationalized as the tendency to refrain from playing from the disadvantageous decks) increase linearly with age, with adults avoiding disadvantageous decks at higher rates than both preadolescents and adolescents. The finding that adolescents, compared to adults, are relatively more approach oriented in response to positive feedback and less avoidant in response to negative feedback is consistent with recent studies of brain development, as well as epidemiological data on various types of risky behavior, and may have important practical implications for the prevention of adolescent risk taking.},

	abstract = {Individuals with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) show marked impairments in their ability to generate self-initiated, or "voluntary", saccadic eye movements. Investigations of visually guided, or "reflexive", saccades have, on the other hand, produced inconclusive results with studies showing response times ({RTs}) in persons with {PD} that are slower, faster, or indistinguishable from those of controls. We performed a meta-analysis to establish whether there are consistent effects of {PD} on the metrics of visually guided saccades. Combining results across 47 studies we found that reflexive saccades are overall initiated more slowly in persons with {PD} than in controls, however, this analysis also revealed considerable heterogeneity across studies. Step-wise meta-regression, using eleven potential predictors, subsequently showed that differences in mean {RT} between controls and persons with {PD} may arise due to aspects of experimental design. In particular, mean target eccentricity was shown to impact substantially on {RTs} such that persons with {PD} predictably initiate saccades faster than controls at small target eccentricities, while responding more slowly for large target eccentricities. Changes in eye-tracking and display equipment over the period covered by the review were also found to have impacted on the pattern of results obtained. We conclude that a, previously unsuspected, eccentricity effect could explain why the saccadic eye movements of persons with {PD} are sometimes found to be "hyper-reflexive" compared to controls, and suggest that this effect may arise due to {PD}-induced changes in both peripheral perceptual processing and in central executive mechanisms involving the basal ganglia. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An alternative interpretation is that it represents the time needed to decide whether a target is in fact present: decision processes are necessarily stochastic, because they depend on extracting information from noisy sensory signals. In one such model, the presence of a target causes a signal in a decision unit to rise linearly at a rate r from its initial value s0 until it reaches a fixed threshold theta, when a saccade is initiated. One can regard this decision signal as a neural estimate of the log likelihood of the hypothesis that the target is present, the threshold being the significance criterion or likelihood level at which the target is presumed to be present. Experiments manipulating the prior probability of the target's appearing confirm this notion: the latency distribution then changes in the way expected if s0 simply reflects the prior log likelihood of the stimulus.},

	abstract = {We investigated why we have no perception of a smeared image resulting from the reduction in contrast (grey-out) occurring at the retina during saccadic eye movements. By turning on light in the experimental room only during the eye movement, we were able to show that this grey-out was perceived as a smeared image of the visual scene. However, when the experimental room was illuminated before and/or after the saccade as well as during the saccade, perception of the grey-out was obliterated. During a period of fixation, perception of a blank image comparable in duration to an eye movement could also be eliminated by a preceding or following clear image. We conclude that lack of perception during saccadic eye movements made in normal contoured environments results primarily from the visual "masking" effect of a clear image before and/or after the eye movement acting on the grey-out during the eye movement. This "saccadic omission" is entirely a visual phenomenon and is far more powerful than the usually studied elevation of visual threshold for detection of a flash, "saccadic suppression.". ?? 1978.},

Different neural populations seem to be involved in the generation of the {MAE}, depending on the spatiotemporal characteristics of both adapting and test stimuli. Although the tuning mechanisms of the neural populations involved in the {MAE} have been psychophysically identified, the specific loci along the motion processing hierarchy where the different types of {MAE} take place is still debated. Method: In this study, by using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ({rTMS}) delivered during the inter-stimulus interval ({ISI}) between adapting and test patterns, we investigated the cortical locus of processing of static {MAE} ({sMAE}) and dynamic {MAE} ({dMAE}). Results: Results showed that {rTMS} over V2/V3 or V5/{MT} decreased the perceived duration of both {sMAE} and {dMAE}, although {rTMS} over V2/V3 decreased mainly the perceived duration of {sMAE}. Conclusions: {sMAE} and {dMAE} rely on the same cortical structures present at intermediate and low-levels of motion processing, although low-level visual areas (e.g., V2/V3) show a prevalence of neurons responsible for {sMAE}. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Its retinotopic organization and the interactions recently found between motion adaptation and misperceived localization may suggest, for this area, a role for priming of spatial position in addition to the established priming of motion direction. Disruption of V5/{MT} with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation during the intertrial interval had the effect of abolishing priming of motion direction but no effect in priming of spatial position. These effects cannot be explained in terms of perception or task demands but only in terms of the effects of information irrelevant to the correct performance of the task stored over the intertrial interval. We suggest that the attribute of spatial position might be stored in short-term memory either in earlier areas of the motion pathways such as V3 or in higher cortical areas traditionally associated with the analysis of spatial information, for example, posterior parietal cortex or the frontal eye fields.},

In recent years, evidence from animal models of Parkinson's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post-receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements. Recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms, dopamine receptor subtypes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and non-dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

These regions displayed five distinct region-specific patterns of age-related differences in other diffusivity properties: (1) increases in both radial and mean diffusivity; (2) increases in radial diffusivity; (3) no differences in parameters other than {FA}; (4) a decrease in axial and an increase in radial diffusivity; and (5) a decrease in axial and mean diffusivity. These patterns suggest different biological underpinnings of age-related decline in {FA}, such as demyelination, Wallerian degeneration, gliosis, and severe fiber loss, and may represent stages in a cascade of age-related degeneration in white matter microstructure. This first simultaneous description of age-related differences in {FA}, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity requires histological and functional validation as well as analyses of intermediate age groups and longitudinal samples. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Patients with Parkinson's disease ({PD}) show slowed movement initiation and can have deficits in executive function, leading to impairments in controlling involuntary behavior. This results in difficulties performing an antisaccade, which requires one to suppress an automatic eye movement (a prosaccade) to a visual stimulus, and execute a voluntary eye movement in the opposite direction. Antisaccade deficits are similar to those seen in task switching, whereby one is required to change a response after performing a different behavior. Both antisaccade (Hood et al., 2007) and task switching (Cools, Barker, Sahakian, \& Robbins, 2001) deficits in {PD} have been attributed to fronto-basal ganglia ({BG}) dysfunction. Previously, we demonstrated with functional magnetic resonance imaging that {BG} circuitry is important to both task switching and voluntary saccade generation, as greater caudate activation was seen when healthy young adults first prepared a prosaccade, but then switched to an antisaccade (Cameron, Coe, et al., 2009). Therefore, we hypothesized that {PD} patients would have difficulty switching from one saccade response to the other, with particular impairment in switching from a pro to an antisaccade. Here, we not only confirmed this prediction, but also showed that {PD} patients performed better than controls in switching from an anti to a prosaccade. This suggests that task switching deficits in {PD} are particularly pronounced when more automatic behavior needs to be overridden with alternative behavior. We suggest that this occurs primarily at the level of establishing the appropriate task set, which is an internalized rule that governs how to respond. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The spatial frequency at which least contrast is required to see sinusoidal gratings decreases as their velocity increases, but peak sensitivity is identical at all velocities up to 800 deg/sec. Similarly, the wider a single bar, the higher the velocity at which it is best visible. A bar 80 deg wide is best seen when moving at 300-500 deg/sec, and can be seen, and its direction of motion identified, even when moving at 10(4) deg/sec. These results show that motion does not diminish the visual passband, but instead slides the spatial frequency window along the spatial frequency scale, maintaining peak sensitivity at a temporal frequency of about 10 Hz (at photopic luminances).},

	abstract = {The present work explored the effects of reward in the well-known global effect paradigm in which two objects appear simultaneously in close spatial proximity. The experiment consisted of three phases (i) a pre-training phase that served as a baseline, (ii) a reward-training phase to associate differently colored stimuli with high, low and no reward value, and (iii) a post-training phase in which rewards were no longer delivered, to examine whether objects previously associated with higher reward value attracted the eyes more strongly than those associated with low or no reward value. Unlike previous reward studies, the differently valued objects directly competed with each other on the same trial. The results showed that initially eye movements were not biased towards any particular stimulus, while in the reward-training phase, eye movements started to land progressively closer towards stimuli that were associated with a high reward value. Even though rewards were no longer delivered, this bias remained robustly present in the post-training phase. A time course analysis showed that the effect of reward was present for the fastest saccades (around 170. ms) and increased with increasing latency. Although strategic effects for slower saccades cannot be ruled out, we suggest that fast oculomotor responses became habituated and were no longer under strategic attentional control. Together the results imply that reward affects oculomotor competition in favor of stimuli previously associated high reward, when multiple reward associated objects compete for selection.},

Before target motion onset, a monetary reward cue indicated whether participants could earn money by tracking accurately, or whether the trial was unrewarded (Experiments 1 and 2, n = 11 each). Reward significantly improved eye-movement accuracy across different levels of task difficulty. Improvements were seen even in the earliest phase of the eye movement, within 70 ms of tracking onset, indicating that reward impacts visual-motor processing at an early level.

Recent research with the Iowa Gambling Task suggests decision-making impairments in {PG}. These deficits are usually attributed to disturbances in feedback processing and associated functional alterations of the orbitofrontal cortex. However, previous studies with other clinical populations found relations between executive (dorsolateral prefrontal) functions and decision-making using a task with explicit rules for gains and losses, the Game of Dice Task. In the present study, we assessed 25 male {PG} patients and 25 male healthy controls with the Game of Dice Task. {PG} patients showed pronounced deficits in the Game of Dice Task, and the frequency of risky decisions was correlated with executive functions and feedback processing. Therefore, risky decisions of {PG} patients might be influenced by both dorsolateral prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex dysfunctions. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {An object moving in the visual field triggers a saccade that brings its image onto the fovea. It is followed by a combination of slow eye movements and catch-up saccades that try to keep the target image on the fovea as long as possible. The accuracy of this ability to track the “here-and- now” location of a visual target contrasts with the spatiotemporally distributed nature of its encoding in the brain. We show in six experimentally naive monkeys how this performance is acquired and gradually evolves during successive daily sessions. During the early exposure, the tracking is mostly saltatory, made of relatively large saccades separated by low eye velocity episodes, demonstrating that accurate (here and now) pursuit is not spontaneous and that gaze direction lags behind its location most of the time. Over the sessions, while the pursuit velocity is enhanced, the gaze is more frequently directed toward the current target location as a consequence of a 25\% reduction in the number of catch-up saccades and a 37\% reduction in size (for the first saccade). This smoothing is observed at several scales: during the course of single trials, across the set of trials within a session, and over successive sessions. We explain the neurophysi- ological processes responsible for this combined evolution of sac- cades and pursuit in the absence of stringent training constraints. More generally, our study shows that the oculomotor system can be used to discover the neural mechanisms underlying the ability to synchronize a motor effector with a dynamic external event.},

This dilemma reopens the old question of "what is learned."

The reinforcement procedure merely permits both expectancies to be learned. (36 ref.) ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

To test this possibility, the production of anticipatory slow eye movements in humans was studied using apparent motion stimuli. Short range apparent motion was produced with random dot stimuli and the anticipatory slow eye movements were isolated from the smooth pursuit responses by occasionally including trials in which the random dot stimulus did not appear. Long range apparent motion was produced with subjective contour stimuli. Both short range and long range apparent motion were found to be effective stimuli for anticipatory slow eye movements. The prominence of perceived motion was altered by changing the spatiotemporal displacement intervals in the short range apparent motion stimuli. Changing the subjective contours also changed the motion percepts of the long range apparent motion stimuli. With both stimuli, the peak anticipatory slow eye velocities that were achieved decreased as the prominence of the motion percepts decreased, while the time-course of the anticipatory responses were similar under the different conditions. These findings indicate that the expectation of perceived motion is necessary for anticipatory slow eye movements.},

	abstract = {Cocaine abusers demonstrate faulty decision-making as manifested by their inability to discontinue self-destructive drug-seeking behaviors. The orbitofrontal cortex ({OFC}) plays an important role in decision-making. In this preliminary study we tested whether 25-day-abstinent cocaine abusers show alterations in normalized cerebral blood flow ({rCBF}) in the {OFC} using {PET} with15O during the Iowa Gambling Task (a decision-making task). This task measures the ability to weigh short-term rewards against long-term losses. A control task matched the sensorimotor aspects of the task but did not require decision-making. Cocaine abusers (N = 13) showed greater activation during performance of the Iowa Gambling Task in the right {OFC} and less activation in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ({DLPFC}) and left medial prefrontal cortex ({MPFC}) compared to a control group (N = 13). Better Iowa Gambling Task performance was associated with greater activation in the right {OFC} in both groups. Also, the amount of cocaine used (grams/week) prior to the 25 days of enforced abstinence was negatively correlated with activation in the left {OFC}. Greater activation in the {OFC} in cocaine abusers compared to a control group may reflect differences in the anticipation of reward while less activation in the {DLPFC} and {MPFC} may reflect differences in planning and working memory. These findings suggest that cocaine abusers show persistent functional abnormalities in prefrontal neural networks involved in decision-making and these effects are related to cocaine abuse. Compromised decision-making could contribute to the development of addiction and undermine attempts at abstinence. © 2003 Elsevier Science ({USA}). All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiological studies have identified a number of brain regions critically involved in solving the problem of action selection or decision making. In the case of highly practiced tasks, these regions include cortical areas hypothesized to integrate evidence supporting alternative actions and the basal ganglia, hypothesized to act as a central switch in gating behavioral requests. However, despite our relatively detailed knowledge of basal ganglia biology and its connectivity with the cortex and numerical simulation studies demonstrating selective function, no formal theoretical framework exists that supplies an algorithmic description of these circuits. This article shows how many aspects of the anatomy and physiology of the circuit involving the cortex and basal ganglia are exactly those required to implement the computation defined by an asymptotically optimal statistical test for decision making: the multihypothesis sequential probability ratio test ({MSPRT}). The resulting model of basal ganglia provides a new framework for understanding the computation in the basal ganglia during decision making in highly practiced tasks. The predictions of the theory concerning the properties of particular neuronal populations are validated in existing experimental data. Further, we show that this neurobiologically grounded implementation of {MSPRT} outperforms other candidates for neural decision making, that it is structurally and parametrically robust, and that it can accommodate cortical mechanisms for decision making in a way that complements those in basal ganglia.},

In this study, we investigated reward and punishment processing in young, never-medicated Parkinson's disease patients, recently medicated patients receiving the dopamine receptor agonists pramipexole and ropinirole and healthy controls. The never-medicated patients were also re-evaluated after 12 weeks of treatment with dopamine agonists. Reward and punishment processing was assessed by a feedback-based probabilistic classification task. Personality characteristics were measured by the temperament and character inventory. Results revealed that never-medicated patients with Parkinson's disease showed selective deficits on reward processing and novelty seeking, which were remediated by dopamine agonists. These medications disrupted punishment processing. In addition, dopamine agonists increased the correlation between reward processing and novelty seeking, whereas these drugs decreased the correlation between punishment processing and harm avoidance. Our finding that dopamine agonist administration in young patients with Parkinson's disease resulted in increased novelty seeking, enhanced reward processing, and decreased punishment processing may shed light on the cognitive and personality bases of the impulse control disorders, which arise as side-effects of dopamine agonist therapy in some Parkinson's disease patients.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE} {OF} {REVIEW}: The mainstay of treatment for Parkinson's disease remains medical therapy. With improved surgical precision and decreased morbidity, stereotactic lesioning and deep brain stimulation have become more popular. New therapies currently in clinical trials include gene therapy and direct drug delivery to the brain. The present review discusses surgical therapies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and the status of experimental strategies currently in preclinical and clinical testing. {RECENT} {FINDINGS}: Both stereotactic ablation and deep brain stimulation of the thalamus, globus pallidus interna, and subthalamic nucleus are discussed and compared in the current literature. New therapies such as drug infusions into the brain, gene therapy, and neural transplantation are in clinical trials and have been tested extensively in animals. Safety and efficacy of such therapies are discussed in recent literature. {SUMMARY}: Although medication remains the first and main line of treatment and the mainstay for Parkinson's disease, advances in techniques and safety of operations have made surgical interventions more popular. Thalamic surgery remains helpful only in a limited subset of patients with predominent tremor that is unresponsive to medication. Bilateral subthalamic nucleus {DBS} holds the most promising results for patients with tremor, severe motor fluctuations and dyskinesias from L-dopa, with the best improvements seen in daily activities and quality of life. Newer therapies currently in clinical trial include gene therapy to replace lost gamma-aminobutyric acid inputs to the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus interna/substantia nigra pars reticulata, and infusion of recombinant glial derived neurotrophic factor to support at-risk nigrostriatal neurons. Further developments in these areas, along with evolution in stem cell science that hopefully will permit replacement of lost neurons, may alter the nature of surgical practice in Parkinson's disease patients in the not too distant future.},

	abstract = {What roles do mesolimbic and neostriatal dopamine systems play in reward? Do they mediate the hedonic impact of rewarding stimuli? Do they mediate hedonic reward learning and {associatiÕe} prediction? Our review of the literature, together with results of a new study of residual reward capacity after dopamine depletion, indicates the answer to both questions is `no'. Rather, dopamine systems may mediate the {incentiÕe} salience of rewards, modulating their motivational value in a manner separable from hedonia and reward learning. In a study of the consequences of dopamine loss, rats were depleted of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and neostriatum by up to 99\% using 6-hydroxydopamine. In a series of experiments, we applied the `taste reactivity' measure of affective reactions gapes, ̌Z etc. to assess the capacity of dopamine-depleted rats for: 1 normal affect hedonic and aversive reactions , 2 modulation of hedonic .. ̌Z . . affect ̌Z. . by associative learning taste aversion conditioning , and 3 hedonic enhancement of affect by non-dopaminergic pharmacological manipulation ̌Z.of palatability benzodiazepine administration . We found normal hedonic reaction patterns to sucrose vs. quinine, normal learning ̌Z.of new hedonic stimulus values a change in palatability based on predictive relations , and normal pharmacological hedonic enhancement of palatability. We discuss these results in the context of hypotheses and data concerning the role of dopamine in reward. We review neurochemical, electrophysiological, and other behavioral evidence. We conclude that dopamine systems are not needed either to mediate the hedonic pleasure of reinforcers or to mediate predictive associations involved in hedonic reward learning. We conclude instead that dopamine may be more important to {incentiÕe} salience attributions to the neural representations of reward-related stimuli. Incentive salience, we suggest, is a distinct component of motivation and reward. In other words, dopamine systems are necessary for `wanting' {incentiÕes}, but not for `liking' them or for learning new `likes' and `dislikes'. q1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The activity of these neurons is commonly thought to represent ordinal position within the trial. However, they might also be sensitive to factors correlated with ordinal position including time elapsed during the trial (which is greater for each successive stage) and the degree of anticipation of reward (which probably increases at each successive stage). To compare the influences of these factors, we monitored neuronal activity in the supplementary motor area ({SMA}), presupplementary motor area (pre-{SMA}), supplementary eye field ({SEF}), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the performance of a serial order task (requiring a series of saccades in three specified directions), a variable reward task (in which a cue displayed early in the trial indicated whether the reward received at the end of the trial would be large or small), and a long delay task (in which the monkey had simply to maintain fixation during a period of time approximating the duration of an average trial in the serial order task). We found that rank signals were partially correlated with sensitivity to elapsed time and anticipated reward. The connection to elapsed time was strongest in the pre-{SMA}. The connection to anticipated reward was most pronounced in the {SMA} and {SEF}. However, critically, these factors could not fully explain rank selectivity in any of the areas tested.},

It also activated three medial regions not previously identified in human neuroimaging studies of pursuit: the precuneus and the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices. All six areas were also activated during saccades. The spatial extent of activation was similar for saccades and pursuit in all but two regions: spatial extent was greater for saccades in the superior branch of the frontal eye field and greater for pursuit in posterior cingulate cortex.

During the course of pursuing a moving target there are often periods of transient disap-pearance as it moves behind objects and surfaces. In experimental settings, eye velocity decays rapidly on the extinction of a moving target. However, eye velocity does not decay to zero if there is an expectation the target will reappear further along its trajectory. In-creasing eye velocity to coincide with target reappearance could minimize the developing velocity error, but it remains to be empiri-cally verified whether this can be achieved. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of stimulus predictability, target velocity, and interstimulus interval ({ISI}) on ocular pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target. We confirmed that subjects (n ϭ 9) did not maintain eye velocity close to target velocity for the duration of the {ISI}. In general, after an initial reduction in eye velocity the majority of subjects (n ϭ 7) exhibited a significant increase before target reappearance. The timing of the velocity increase was not influenced by target velocity, stimulus predictability, or {ISI}. Conse-quently, for the 900-ms {ISI} the increase occurred too early and the eye was decelerating at the moment of target reappearance. These results are consistent with a reduction in gain being applied to the visuomotor drive when the target disappeared, followed by a reactivation in expectation of target reappearance. We modeled this process such that gain was modulated within a reafferent feedback system, hence pre-serving its output in the absence of negative visual feedback and enabling an anticipatory increase in eye velocity before expected target reappearance. I N T R O D U C T I O N Given the long delays in the processing of visual feedback, anticipation is crucial for fluent and precisely timed motor control. Appropriately timed and scaled anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements compensate for the delayed, reactive response to visual feedback (Kowler and Steinman 1979; Ohashi and Barnes 1996), and hence bring the target image close to the fovea, reduce blur, and aid perception of fast moving objects. In humans, with regularly timed, repeated presentation of target motion stimuli, smooth pursuit precedes target onset by several hundred milliseconds (Barnes and As-selman 1991; Kao and Morrow 1994). Anticipatory smooth pursuit can be elicited having viewed a moving target while the eyes are fixated on a central target (Barnes et al. 1997) and can be scaled by symbolic cues regarding upcoming target velocity (Jarrett and Barnes 2001). These findings indicate that antici-patory smooth pursuit is not simply a direct consequence of an efference copy of the eye movement. The initiation of smooth pursuit before target onset can also be generated by context-dependent cues and has been interpreted to be the result of sudden activation of an on-line gain-controlling element (Tanaka and Fukushima 1997; Tanaka and Lisberger 2000).},

	abstract = {Stationary periodic visual patterns (row of equally spaced dots or black-white stripes) of the period Ps illuminated stroboscopically with a flash frequency fs induce an apparent movement perception (sigma-movement) when slow eye movements are performed across the periodic pattern. The movement appears in the direction of the eye movements when the angular speed {VE} of the eyes corresponds to the following condition: Ve = k . Ps . fs [deg . s-1] (1) k is a constant and equals 1 (or exceptionally 2 or 3). The sigma-movement induces a sigma-{OKN} with an average angular speed of its slow phases corresponding to Eq.(1). sigma-{OKN} can be elicited when identical foveal or identical extrafoveal stimulus patterns are applied from flash to flash. A considerable random variability of the flash sequence does not interrupt the sigma-movement and the sigma-{OKN}. Both phenomena can also be elicited by a stimulus pattern with its periodicity hidden in spatial noise and this periodic pattern only becomes visible during the eye movements. It is argued that the sigma-phenomena are caused by efference copy signals of the gaze control system, which interact with the afferent signals (displacement of visual stimuli on the retina) at different levels of the afferent visual system. One interaction is supposed at a cortical level where the extrapersonal visual space is represented.},

	abstract = {Accurate ocular pursuit during a transient occlusion interval would minimize retinal position and velocity error, and could provide an advantage when discriminating object characteristics at reappearance. This study was designed to examine how the smooth and saccadic response extrapolates the trajectory of a moving visual object during a transient occlusion. We confirmed that subjects could not maintain unity gain smooth pursuit during the transient occlusion. Eye velocity decayed significantly without visual feedback but then in the majority of subjects, there was a recovery that brought eye velocity back towards object velocity. However, eye velocity did not increase to a level that eliminated the developing position error. Subjects corrected for the resulting error in eye position by releasing saccades that generally placed the eye ahead of the occluded object's extrapolated position. The majority of saccadic correction occurred between 220 and 600 ms of the occlusion interval, and when combined with the smooth response enabled accurate pursuit of a 10 degrees/s object for up to 1,200 ms of occlusion. The lack of saccadic correction after 600 ms of occlusion combined with the reduced eye velocity resulted in significant undershoot of eye position at the moment of object reappearance when pursuing an 18 degrees/s object. We suggest that extra-retinal information regarding eye velocity and smooth eye displacement could be available from a continually updating efference copy of eye motion in {MST}, whereas a veridical representation of extrapolated object velocity and displacement could be obtained from persistent activity in {FEF}.},

When there is a change in target velocity during a transient, any recovery should ideally be scaled and hence predictive of the expected target velocity at reappearance. This study confirmed that subjects did not maintain eye velocity close to target velocity for the duration of the inter-stimulus interval ({ISI}). The majority of subjects exhibited an initial reduction in eye velocity followed by a scaled recovery prior to target reappearance. Eye velocity during the {ISI} was, therefore, predictive of the expected change in target velocity.

In addition, the analysis demonstrates that the preparatory processes of two different saccades may overlap in time ("parallel programming") and that, although reacting in a discontinuous manner, the saccadic system continuously processes the afferent visual information. A conceptual model based on an internal predictive feedback pathway and on a non-linear decision mechanism is proposed that accounts for the observed behaviour. © 1979.},

However, the same neural systems are involved in working memory, impulse control and decision-making. Can social cognition be decomposed into these more basic mechanisms, which are rooted in neuroscience, in both human and animal studies? What are the manifestations at the social level if any of these mechanisms were impaired? Many instances of social cognition involve judgment/decision-making about social conventions, intentions of others, trust, morals, ethics, and so on. Is the mechanism for these judgments specialized for social information? Or can we tie all these instances to known mechanisms of decision-making, albeit that judgment may take different forms? These are important questions to consider because introducing functional terms that are mere descriptions of the social behavior modelled by a given task without tying the behavior to its root components, or using different languages to describe the same neural system in 2 different fields, would inevitably lead to confusion and poor understanding of the neurology of social cognition.

Three groups of subjects were tested, substance dependent individuals ({SD}) (n=41), normal controls (n=40), and {VM} patients (n=5). All {SD} met the {DSM}-{IV} criteria for dependence, with either alcohol or stimulants (metamphetamine or cocaine) as the primary substance of choice. The results revealed a significant impairment in the performance of {SD} relative to normal controls. A significantly high proportion of {SD} (61 vs. only 32.5\% of normal controls) performed within the range of the {VM} patients, while the rest performed within the range of normal controls. General demographic factors such as age, sex, and level of education could not explain these differences in performance. As well, differences in performance were not explained by intelligence ({IQ}), memory, or performance on standard executive function/frontal lobe tests. Performance on the gambling task was best predicted by a combination of factors, including duration of abstinence, years of abuse, relapses and times in treatment, and the ability to hold gainful employment. The results support the hypothesis that impairment in decision-making linked to a dysfunctional {VM} cortex is associated with at least a sub-group of {SD}. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {Most theories of choice assume that decisions derive from an assessment of the future outcomes of various options and alternatives through some type of cost-benefit analyses. The influence of emotions on decision-making is largely ignored. The studies of decision-making in neurological patients who can no longer process emotional information normally suggest that people make judgments not only by evaluating the consequences and their probability of occurring, but also and even sometimes primarily at a gut or emotional level. Lesions of the ventromedial (which includes the orbitofrontal) sector of the prefrontal cortex interfere with the normal processing of "somatic" or emotional signals, while sparing most basic cognitive functions. Such damage leads to impairments in the decision-making process, which seriously compromise the quality of decisions in daily life. The aim of this paper is to review evidence in support of "The Somatic Marker Hypothesis," which provides a systems-level neuroanatomical and cognitive framework for decision-making and suggests that the process of decision-making depends in many important ways on neural substrates that regulate homeostasis, emotion, and feeling. The implications of this theoretical framework for the normal and abnormal development of the orbitofrontal cortex are also discussed. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Nuclei within the basal ganglia ({BG}), in particular the substantia nigra pars reticulata ({SNr}), subthalamic nucleus ({STN}) and caudate nucleus, are known to be involved in the generation of rapid or saccadic eye movements. Neurons in the {SNr} are active tonically and generally show a pause, but also increase, in discharge rate, for the appearance of visual stimuli and the generation of saccades. Recent experimental results in oculomotor regions of the brainstem reveal overlap in the neuronal pathways used for saccades and smooth pursuit, or slow tracking, eye movements. Whether the overlap of processing for saccades and pursuit extends to the oculomotor {BG} is unknown. In the present report, we were interested in whether the overlap between the pursuit and saccadic systems extends into the oculomotor {BG}. Using single-neuron recording and electrical stimulation techniques, we tested whether neurons within the saccade portion of the {BG}, the {SNr}, could be involved in smooth pursuit eye movements. Monkeys were required to follow visual targets with either a smooth eye movement or a saccade while we recorded from {SNr} neurons. We report here on {SNr} neuronal activity that was modulated during the performance of visually guided saccades and also during the initiation and the maintenance of smooth pursuit eye movements. Importantly, the modulation of neuronal activity during pursuit was present even when catch-up saccades were absent. The majority of {SNr} neurons was active tonically and their discharge ceased during pursuit, although some neurons also increased their discharge rate during smooth pursuit, similar to the behaviour reported for saccades. We also found that electrical stimulation of the {SNr} during the initiation of pursuit suppressed ipsiversive and, in some cases, enhanced contraversive pursuit. Our combined recording and stimulation results are consistent with the hypothesis that the overlap between the pursuit and saccadic systems extends, at least somewhat, into the {BG} and that the signal conveyed by the {SNr} can be used by the pursuit system. Like the signal for saccades, the {SNr} may provide a permissive disinhibition for pursuit eye movements. We hypothesize that alterations in this signal in {BG} diseased states such as Parkinson's may explain in part the deficits observed in smooth pursuit eye movements of these patients.},

	abstract = {During pursuit of moving targets that temporarily disappear, residual smooth eye movements represent the internal (extra-retinal) component of pursuit. However, this response is dependent on expectation of target reappearance. By comparing responses with and without such expectation during early random-onset pursuit, we examined the temporal development of the extra-retinal component and compared it with anticipatory pursuit, another form of internally driven response. In an initial task (mid-ramp extinction), a moving, random-velocity target was initially visible for 100 or 150 ms but then extinguished for 600 ms before reappearing and continuing to move. Responses comprised an initial visually driven rapid rise in eye velocity, followed by a secondary slower increase during extinction. In a second task (short ramp), with identical initial target presentation but no expectation of target reappearance, the initial rapid rise in eye velocity was followed by decay toward zero. The expectation-dependent difference between responses to these tasks increased in velocity during extinction much more slowly than the initial, visually driven component. In a third task (initial extinction), the moving target was extinguished at motion onset but reappeared 600 ms later. Repetition of identical stimuli evoked anticipatory pursuit triggered by initial target offset. Temporal development and scaling of this anticipatory response, which was based on remembered velocity from prior stimuli, was remarkably similar to and covaried with the difference between mid-ramp extinction and short ramp tasks. Results suggest a common mechanism is responsible for anticipatory pursuit and the extra-retinal component of random-onset pursuit, a finding that is consistent with a previously developed model of pursuit.},

	abstract = {We assessed the ability to extract velocity information from brief exposure of a moving target and sought evidence that this information could be used to modulate the extraretinal component of ocular pursuit. A step-ramp target motion was initially visible for a brief randomized period of 50, 100, 150, or 200 ms, but then extinguished for a randomized period of 400 or 600 ms before reappearing and continuing along its trajectory. Target speed (5-20 degrees /s), direction (left/right), and intertrial interval (2.7-3.7 s) were also randomized. Smooth eye movements were initiated after about 130 ms and comprised an initial visually dependent component, which reached a peak velocity that increased with target velocity and initial exposure duration, followed by a sustained secondary component that actually increased throughout extinction for 50- and 100-ms initial exposures. End-extinction eye velocity, reflecting extraretinal drive, increased with initial exposure from 50 to 100 ms but remained similar for longer exposures; it was significantly scaled to target velocity for 150- and 200-ms exposures. The results suggest that extraretinal drive is based on a sample of target velocity, mostly acquired during the first 150 ms, that is stored and forms a goal for generating appropriately scaled eye movements during absence of visual input. End-extinction eye velocity was significantly higher when target reappearance was expected than when it was not, confirming the importance of expectation in generating sustained smooth movement. However, end-extinction eye displacement remained similar irrespective of expectation, suggesting that the ability to use sampled velocity information to predict future target displacement operates independently of the control of smooth eye movement.},

	abstract = {This study examines the effects of expectation on the timing of ocular pursuit termination. Human subjects pursued repeated, constant velocity (15 or 30 degrees/s) target motion stimuli (ramps), moving left or right. Ramps were of constant duration ({RD} = 240, 480, 720 or 960 ms), resulting in anticipatory slowing of eye velocity prior to ramp termination and target extinction. At unexpected intervals {RD} was increased or decreased, but velocity remained constant. When {RD} increased eye velocity continued to decline, even though the target remained visible and continued to move. It took approximately 180 ms before eye velocity started to recover towards the steady state velocity level for the continued target motion. When {RD} decreased, eye velocity continued as if for a longer ramp duration, again taking approximately 180 ms before eye velocity started to decrease. These results suggest that timing of the response to the expected ramp duration had been pre-programmed on the basis of prior experience of ramp duration. Moreover, adjustments to timing occurred rapidly, within the second presentation of the new {RD}. Responses were compared to control conditions with randomised ramp duration. Eye velocity declined later in the controls for {RD}  or = 720 ms, as expected, but exhibited similar decline in predictable and randomised conditions for {RD} = 960 ms. Further controls established that eye velocity could only be reliably maintained until the end of the ramp when the target was expected to continue in motion after the end of the ramp. The results suggest that estimates of stimulus duration are made continuously in all conditions, based on expectancy of target termination.},

	abstract = {It has been established that repeated presentation of a transient target motion stimulus such as a constant- velocity ramp leads to the build up of steady state ({SS}), anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements after two or three presentations. Each {SS} response is then composed of the anticipatory component of nonvisual origin, a visual component associated with the stimulus presentation and another nonvisual component that represents the decay of the response after extinction of the stimulus. Here we investigated the interactions that occur when each motion stimulus was itself a sequence containing more than one ramp component. Ramp components had a velocity of 15°/s or 30°/s to left or right and were separated by gaps of 200 ms duration. In an initial experiment, responses to 2-ramp stimuli were examined and compared with responses to the single-ramp stimuli from which they were constituted. We present evidence that the anticipatory, nonvisual components of the double-ramp response result from the linear summation of the nonvisual components of the responses to the constituent single-ramp components. In a 2nd experiment, we examined responses to a wide variety of 4-ramp sequences and again found evidence that, in the {SS}, the responses were formed from the linear summation of the constituent single-ramp components. Regression analysis performed on the velocity at onset of each ramp component indicated that this nonvisual part of the response was predictive of the upcoming ramp component. To confirm this, unexpected changes were introduced into single ramp components of the 4-ramp sequence after at least five prior presentations of the sequence had allowed a {SS} response to be established. Subjects continued to initiate a response to the modified component that was appropriate in velocity and direction for the corresponding part of the previous sequence and inappropriate for the newly modified stimulus. This preprogrammed response persisted unmodified for more than 170 ms after onset of the modified ramp component. In contrast, in the second presentation of the new sequence, the anticipatory component of the response was highly correlated with the {SS} response of the new sequence, but not with that of the prior sequence, showing that the preprogrammed response had been modified very rapidly. Similar behaviour was observed whichever of the 4-ramp components was modified, indicating that the velocity and direction of the anticipatory response to each component had been preprogrammed. The results suggest that velocity information related to at least four elements of a sequence can be temporarily stored and subsequently released with appropriate temporal order to form an anticipatory response throughout the whole sequence.},

	abstract = {Regular, repeated presentation of identical constant-velocity target motion stimuli (ramps) appears to allow build up of an internal store, release of which can be used to generate anticipatory smooth pursuit prior to subsequent target onset. Here, we examine whether release of the anticipatory response can be controlled by timing cues unrelated to the motion stimulus itself. In experiment 1, the target moved in alternate directions and was exposed for 480 ms as it passed through centre; otherwise subjects were in darkness. Inter-stimulus interval ({ISI}) was either regular (3.6 s) or randomized (2.7-4.3 s). Presentations were given with or without audio cues that occurred at a constant cue time ({CT}) prior to target appearance. Even when {ISI} was randomized, cues could be used to generate anticipatory smooth pursuit. Eye velocity (V100) measured 100 ms after target onset (just prior to visual feedback influence) was greater with cues than without and decreased significantly as {CT} increased from 240-960 ms. In experiment 2, we assessed the effects of fixation between presentations and eccentricity of target starting position, using unidirectional ramps. The target was visible for 400 ms and started on, ended on or straddled the midline. Subjects held fixation on the midline until an audio cue signalled that preparation for ensuing target appearance could begin. There was no difference in V100 between starting positions or between presence/absence of fixation. In experiment 3, we compared the effects of using audio, visual or tactile cues. All types of cue evoked anticipatory smooth pursuit, but the response to the visual cue was significantly delayed compared with the others. However, V100 was not significantly different between cues. In all experiments, V100 was scaled in proportion to target velocity over the range 12.5-50 degrees /s, showing that this was a truly predictive response. The results provide evidence that timing and velocity storage can be independently controlled through different sensory channels and suggest that the two functions are probably carried out by separate neural mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Although human subjects cannot normally initiate smooth eye movements in the absence of a moving target, previous experiments have established that such movements can be evoked if the subject is required to pursue a regularly repeated, transient target motion stimulus. We sought to determine whether active pursuit was necessary to evoke such an anticipatory response or whether it could be induced after merely viewing the target motion. Subjects were presented with a succession of ramp target motion stimuli of identical velocity and alternating direction in the horizontal axis. In initial experiments, the target was exposed for only 120 ms as it passed through centre, with a constant interval between presentations. Ramp velocity was varied from +/- 9 to 45 degrees/s in one set of trials; the interval between ramp presentations was varied from 640 to 1920 ms in another. Subjects were instructed either to pursue the moving target from the first presentation or to hold fixation on another, stationary target during the first one, two or three presentations of the moving display. Without fixation, the first smooth movement was initiated with a mean latency of 95 ms after target onset, but with repeated presentations anticipatory smooth movements started to build up before target onset. In contrast, when the subjects fixated the stationary target for three presentations of the moving target, the first movement they made was already anticipatory and had a peak velocity that was significantly greater than that of the first response without prior fixation. The conditions of experiment 1 were repeated in experiment 3 with a longer duration of target exposure (480 ms), to allow higher eye velocities to build up. Again, after three prior fixations, the anticipatory velocity measured at 100 ms after target onset (when visual feedback would be expected to start) was not significantly different to that evoked after the subjects had made three active pursuit responses to the same target motion, reaching a mean of 20 degrees/s for a 50 degrees/s target movement. In a further experiment, we determined whether subjects could use stored information from prior active pursuit to generate anticipatory pursuit in darkness if there was a high expectancy that the target would reappear with identical velocity. Subjects made one predictive response immediately after target disappearance, but very little response thereafter until the time at which they expected the target to reappear, when they were again able to re-vitalize the anticipatory response before target appearance. The findings of these experiments provide evidence that information related to target velocity can be stored and used to generate future anticipatory responses even in the absence of eye movement. This suggests that information for storage is probably derived from a common pre-motor drive signal that is inhibited during fixation, rather than an efference copy of eye movement itself. Furthermore, a high level of expectancy of target appearance can facilitate the release of this stored information in darkness.},

	abstract = {Ocular pursuit responses have been examined in humans in three experiments in which the pursuit target image has been fully or partially stabilised on the fovea by feeding a recorded eye movement signal back to drive the target motion. The objective was to establish whether subjects could volitionally control smooth eye movement to reproduce trajectories of target motion in the absence of a concurrent target motion stimulus. In experiment 1 subjects were presented with a target moving with a triangular waveform in the horizontal axis with a frequency of 0.325 Hz and velocities of +/- 10-50 degrees/s. The target was illuminated twice per cycle for pulse durations ({PD}) of 160-640 ms as it passed through the centre position; otherwise subjects were in darkness. Subjects initially tracked the target motion in a conventional closed-loop mode for four cycles. Prior to the next target presentation the target image was stabilised on the fovea, so that any target motion generated resulted solely from volitional eye movement. Subjects continued to make anticipatory smooth eye movements both to the left and the right with a velocity trajectory similar to that observed in the closed-loop phase. Peak velocity in the stabilised-image mode was highly correlated with that in the prior closed-loop phase, but was slightly less (84\% on average). In experiment 2 subjects were presented with a continuously illuminated target that was oscillated sinusoidally at frequencies of 0.2-1.34 Hz and amplitudes of +/- 5-20 degrees. After four cycles of closed-loop stimulation the image was stabilised on the fovea at the time of peak target displacement. Subjects continued to generate an oscillatory smooth eye velocity pattern that mimicked the sinusoidal motion of the previous closed-loop phase for at least three further cycles. The peak eye velocity generated ranged from 57-95\% of that in the closed-loop phase at frequencies up to 0.8 Hz but decreased significantly at 1.34 Hz. In experiment 3 subjects were presented with a stabilised display throughout and generated smooth eye movements with peak velocity up to 84 degrees/s in the complete absence of any prior external target motion stimulus, by transferring their attention alternately to left and right of the centre of the display. Eye velocity was found to be dependent on the eccentricity of the centre of attention and the frequency of alternation. When the target was partially stabilised on the retina by feeding back only a proportion (Kf = 0.6-0.9) of the eye movement signal to drive the target, subjects were still able to generate smooth movements at will, even though the display did not move as far or as fast as the eye. Peak eye velocity decreased as Kf decreased, suggesting that there was a continuous competitive interaction between the volitional drive and the visual feedback provided by the relative motion of the display with respect to the retina. These results support the evidence for two separate mechanisms of smooth eye movement control in ocular pursuit: reflex control from retinal velocity error feedback and volitional control from an internal source. Arguments are presented to indicate how smooth pursuit may be controlled by matching a voluntarily initiated estimate of the required smooth movement, normally derived from storage of past re-afferent information, against current visual feedback information. Such a mechanism allows preemptive smooth eye movements to be made that can overcome the inherent delays in the visual feedback pathway.},

	abstract = {1. Experiments have been conducted in order to establish the changes in oculomotor activity which take place when the human subject attempts to pursue an intermittently illuminated moving target. 2. In an initial experiment, target motion in the horizontal plane was composed of one or two sinusoids at frequencies between 0.11 and 0.2 Hz. The target was illuminated for varying durations (10-320 ms) at intervals between 40 and 960 ms. As pulse interval was increased or pulse duration was decreased there was a progressive increase in eye velocity gain for the smooth component of eye movement. Some smooth eye movement was generated even when the pulse interval was as large as 960 ms. 3. In a second experiment target motion consisted of a triangular waveform in which target presentation was timed to occur at regular intervals throughout each cycle. Overlaying and averaging the response from several cycles revealed a regular pattern of pulsatile activity associated with each target presentation. This response, which was particularly evident when the pulse interval was greater than 1 s, consisted of an initial build-up of smooth eye velocity followed by an exponential decay with a time constant of 0.5-2 s. When the pulse interval was less than 1 s there was a summation of the transient responses so that eye movement appeared quite smooth when pulse interval was reduced to 320 ms. 4. The pulsatile nature of the response was accentuated when the target was made to execute a staircase-ramp waveform in which the target was illuminated only during the ramp component. The elimination of position change between ramps and the ability to achieve higher target velocity led to clear evidence of the summation of transient oculomotor responses. 5. The summated effects, however, were not simply attributable to the addition of responses to individual target presentations as indicated by the timing of each response. The eye velocity pulse was frequently initiated 200-300 ms prior to target appearance, and well before the time (100 ms) at which visual feedback would be expected to become effective. 6. The effect of target step displacement alone was investigated by examination of the smooth eye movement initiated by varying numbers of steps in the waveform. This showed that the basic step response had a peak velocity of no more than 8-10 deg/s in most individuals.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {1. Experiments have been conducted on human subjects to determine the role of prediction in smooth eye movement control. Subjects were required to actively pursue a small target or stare passively at a larger display as it moved in the horizontal plane. 2. Target motion was basically periodic, but, after a random number of cycles an unexpected change was made in the amplitude, direction or frequency of target motion. Initially, the periodic stimulus took the form of a square waveform. In subsequent experiments, a triangular or sawtooth waveform was used, but in order to examine the timing of the response in relation to stimulus appearance, the target was tachistoscopically illuminated for 40-320 ms at the time that it passed through the mid-line position. 3. When subjects either actively pursued the target or stared passively at the larger display a characteristic pattern of steady-state eye movement was evoked composed of two phases, an initial build-up of eye velocity that reached a peak after 200 ms, followed by a decay phase with a time constant of 0.5-2 s. The build-up phase was initiated prior to target displacement for square-wave motion and before onset of target illumination for other waveforms. 4. The peak eye velocity evoked gradually increased over the first two to four cycles of repeated stimulation. Simultaneously, the response became more phase advanced, the reaction time between stimulus onset and the time at which peak velocity occurred decreasing from an average of 300 to 200 ms for triangular waveform stimuli. 5. When there was a sudden and unexpected change in amplitude and direction of the stimulus waveform, the eye movement induced had a peak velocity and direction that was inappropriate for the current visual stimulus, but which was highly correlated with the features of the preceding sequence in the stimulus. 6. When there was a sudden change in the frequency of the stimulus waveform the predictive eye movement was induced with a timing appropriate to the periodicity of the previous sequence but inappropriate to the new sequence. 7. The results indicate that prediction is carried out through the storage of information about both the magnitude and timing of eye velocity. The trajectory of the averaged eye velocity response was similar in form irrespective of the duration of target exposure or basic stimulus frequency, suggesting that the predictive estimate is released as a stereotyped volley of constant duration but varying magnitude under the control of a periodicity \{estimator.({ABSTRACT}\} \{{TRUNCATED}\} \{{AT}\} 400 \{{WORDS}\})},

	abstract = {Oculomotor response has been assessed in humans during the presentation of conflicting retinal motion stimuli. In the majority of experiments a background stimulus was made to move with a constant velocity ramp in one direction followed by rapid resets at regular intervals. In the absence of an adequate fixation target this ramp-reset stimulus induced a nystagmus with a slow-phase velocity and saccadic frequency which remained almost constant as reset frequency was increased from 2 to 5 Hz. Moreover, the induced eye velocity could be considerably increased if the subject attempted `active' matching of display velocity. During both `active' and `passive' responses eye velocity gain reached a peak when display velocity was between 2°/s and 5°/s. The presence of small stationary targets induced a suppression of the passive ramp-reset response which was modified by target eccentricity and by tachistoscopic target illumination. When subjects pursued a sinusoidally oscillating target against a stationary structured background, eye velocity gain was significantly less than for pursuit against a blank background. The degree of interaction between conflicting stimuli was found to be dependent on their relative size, peripheral location and velocity. However, it appears that the human observer is able selectively to enhance feedback gain from one particular source in order to dominate stimuli from other unwanted sources.},

	abstract = {1. Eye movements have been recorded in man in response to various forms of continuous and discontinuous target motions in the horizontal plane in an attempt to establish the mechanisms of prediction in the pursuit reflex. 2. In an initial experiment the target motion was composed of four sinusoids, each of peak velocity +/- 3.3 deg/s. The three lowest frequencies (0.11, 0.24 and 0.37 Hz) remained constant whereas the highest frequency (F4) was varied from 0.39 to 2.08 Hz. When F4 was 0.39 Hz, all frequency components had a high level of eye velocity gain (mean 0.92) but as F4 was increased there was a significant (P less than 0.001) decline in gain for all three low frequencies which reached a minimum (mean 0.53) when F4 was 1.56 Hz. However, the gain for F4 always remained at a high level, comparable to that evoked by a discrete frequency sinusoid of the same frequency. 3. When the highest-frequency sinusoid was replaced by a square wave of identical amplitude a similar decline in gain for the low frequencies was observed. Eye velocity exhibited a quasi-sinusoidal modulation at the frequency of the square wave even though the rapid steps did not constitute a suitable stimulus to the visual velocity feed-back mechanisms. 4. When only two sinusoids were mixed to form the pursuit stimulus a similar break-down in gain of the lower-frequency component was observed which reached a minimum (mean gain 0.58) when F2 was between 1 and 2 Hz. This implies that the predictability of stimulus motion is dependent, not on the complexity of the stimulus, but on its highest-frequency component. 5. Presentation of square-wave target displacements alone confirmed that smooth eye movements could be evoked by such a stimulus. Eye velocity was at a maximum between 1.0 and 1.5 Hz and was predictive of ensuing target displacement. Responses to staircase step sequences of varying duration indicated that prediction was based on an assessment of the duration of the preceding sequence. 6. Tachistoscopic presentation of targets during low-frequency sinusoidal oscillation indicated that illumination of the target for very short periods (10-320 ms) as few as two times per cycle during minimum velocity phases enhanced the perception of continuous movement. A predictive eye movement was evoked with a high level of peak velocity which then decayed until the subsequent exposure of the target.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {A series of experiments has been conducted on human subjects to examine the effect of the movement of small targets located in the peripheral visual field on oculomotor response. Subjects were presented with either a single centrally positioned target or a pair of targets displaced at angles of +/- 5 degrees, +/- 10 degrees and +/- 20 degrees from centre. Target movement was in the horizontal plane, the paired targets always moving in unison. The stimulus waveform consisted of either a sinusoidal or random target motion encompassing a frequency range from 0.1 to 4 Hz with an angular displacement of +/- 3.5 degrees. Subjects made two types of response. First they were instructed to follow the single target or the centre point of the paired targets. In this 'active' pursuit condition the gain of slow-phase eye velocity progressively decreased as the moving targets were moved from the central position to the most peripheral location (+/- 20 degrees). Secondly, subjects were required passively to ignore the target movement by staring blankly ahead. During this 'passive' response nystagmic eye movements were induced for which the slow-phase eye velocity also decreased with increasing target eccentricity, but the gains were always less than those induced during 'active' pursuit. The frequency characteristics of the 'passive' response were very similar to those of the 'active' response, breaking down at frequencies beyond 1 Hz. The ability to suppress the 'passive' response was also investigated by the presentation of a tachistoscopically illuminated earth-fixed target. The response was found to decline as the interval between presentations of the fixation target was decreased from 3000 ms to 100 ms. It is suggested that the 'passive' response originates from a basic velocity drive to the oculomotor system resulting from image movement across the retina. This velocity drive may be cancelled with adequate fixation but must be enhanced to accomplish desired eye velocity during active pursuit.},

This theoretical dichotomy, however, fails to explain a growing number of cases in which neither current goals nor physical salience can account for strong selection biases. For example, equally salient stimuli associated with reward can capture attention, even when this contradicts current selection goals. Thus, although 'top-down' sources of bias are sometimes defined as those that are not due to physical salience, this conception conflates distinct - and sometimes contradictory - sources of selection bias. We describe an alternative framework, in which past selection history is integrated with current goals and physical salience to shape an integrated priority map. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

In some patients, the disease is associated with a range of visual signs and symptoms, including defects in visual acuity, colour vision, the blink reflex, pupil reactivity, saccadic and smooth pursuit movements and visual evoked potentials. In addition, there may be psychophysical changes, disturbances of complex visual functions such as visuospatial orientation and facial recognition, and chronic visual hallucinations. Some of the treatments associated with {PD} may have adverse ocular reactions. If visual problems are present, they can have an important effect on overall motor function, and quality of life of patients can be improved by accurate diagnosis and correction of such defects. Moreover, visual testing is useful in separating {PD} from other movement disorders with visual symptoms, such as dementia with Lewy bodies ({DLB}), multiple system atrophy ({MSA}) and progressive supranuclear palsy ({PSP}). Although not central to {PD}, visual signs and symptoms can be an important though obscure aspect of the disease and should not be overlooked.},

The pigeons attacked after the last food delivery whether or not the conditioned pecking response was required and whether or not the extinction period was signaled. The food had to be eaten; the mere sight and sound of food being delivered did not produce attack. Prior satiation reduced attack. The phenomenon was not attributable to a past history of competition between pigeons since socially deprived pigeons also attacked. Superstitious reinforcement of attack was not found to be a factor.

	abstract = {Chronic pain can result in anxiety, depression and reduced quality of life. However, its effects on cognitive abilities have remained unclear although many studies attempted to psychologically profile chronic pain. We hypothesized that performance on an emotional decision-making task may be impaired in chronic pain since human brain imaging studies show that brain regions critical for this ability are also involved in chronic pain. Chronic back pain ({CBP}) patients, chronic complex regional pain syndrome ({CRPS}) patients, and normal volunteers (matched for age, sex, and education) were studied on the Iowa Gambling Task, a card game developed to study emotional decision-making. Outcomes on the gambling task were contrasted to performance on other cognitive tasks. The net number of choices made from advantageous decks after subtracting choices made from disadvantageous decks on average was 22.6 in normal subjects (n=26), 13.4 in {CBP} patients (n=26), and -9.5 in {CRPS} patients (n=12), indicating poor performance in the patient groups as compared to the normal controls (P0.004). Only pain intensity assessed during the gambling task was correlated with task outcome and only in {CBP} patients (r=-0.75, P0.003). Other cognitive abilities, such as attention, short-term memory, and general intelligence tested normal in the chronic pain patients. Our evidence indicates that chronic pain is associated with a specific cognitive deficit, which may impact everyday behavior especially in risky, emotionally laden, situations. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of International Association for the Study of Pain.},

We tested 14 {PD} patients (off their medications) and 11 control subjects on antisaccade ({AS}), delayed antisaccade ({DAS}), and remembered antisaccade ({RAS}) paradigms. The three tasks required identical responses, each task only differing in a single manipulation for direct comparison - a delay period was added in the {DAS}, and the target was removed during the delay period of the {RAS} - allowing us to study the specific cognitive processes involved in the execution of a voluntary saccade. Voluntary saccade response times were longer in the {PD} group compared to controls on all three tasks, suggesting difficulties in voluntary saccade execution. Furthermore, {PD} patients showed difficulty suppressing reflexive saccades (increased number of errors in the {AS} task and increased number of disinhibitions in the {DAS} task). Finally, our study did not show significant differences in either response time or error rate between the {RAS} and the {DAS} tasks for either control subjects or {PD} patients. In sum, we report evidence for voluntary saccade execution deficits together with problems inhibiting reflexive saccades in Parkinson's disease patients. These findings were correlated with each other and disease severity, suggesting that eye movement measurement may be a useful tool for studying higher cognitive function. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {In a variety of behavioral tasks, subjects exhibit an automatic and apparently sub- optimal sequential effect: they respond more rapidly and accurately to a stimulus if it reinforces a local pattern in stimulus history, such as a string of repetitions or alternations, compared to when it violates such a pattern. This is often the case even if the local trends arise by chance in the context of a randomized design, such that stimulus history has no real predictive power. In thiswork,we use a normative Bayesian framework to examine the hypothesis that such idiosyncrasies may re- flect the inadvertent engagement ofmechanisms critical for adapting to a changing environment. We show that prior belief in non-stationarity can induce experimen- tally observed sequential effects in an otherwise Bayes-optimal algorithm. The Bayesian algorithm is shown to be well approximated by linear-exponential filter- ing of past observations, a feature also apparent in the behavioral data. We derive an explicit relationship between the parameters and computations of the exact Bayesian algorithm and those of the approximate linear-exponential filter. Since the latter is equivalent to a leaky-integration process, a commonly used model of neuronal dynamics underlying perceptual decision-making and trial-to-trial de- pendencies, our model provides a principled account of why such dynamics are useful. We also show that parameter-tuning of the leaky-integration process is possible, using stochastic gradient descent based only on the noisy binary inputs. This is a proof of concept that not only can neurons implement near-optimal pre- diction based on standard neuronal dynamics, but that they can also learn to tune the processing parameters without explicitly representing probabilities.},

	abstract = {We quantified the horizontal pursuit and saccadic function of 14 parkinsonian patients and 10 normal subjects matched for age. Eight patients had mild, and 6 advanced disease. Ocular motor deficits were more marked in patients with advanced disease. Saccadic reaction times and postsaccadic refractory periods were prolonged. Peak saccadic velocities were significantly reduced. Slow saccades may be caused by inappropriate coactivation of opposing ocular muscles. Multiple step, hypometric saccades were abnormally frequent. Correct final eye position towards a brief target flash was attained without visual feedback. Brief corrective intervals occurred after hypometric saccades. They are attributed to internal (nonvisual) efference copy feedback of eye position errors. Frequent square wave jerks were also a feature of Parkinson's disease. Smooth pursuit gain was lowered in all patients while tracking sinusoidal targets at frequencies from 0.25 to 1 Hz. Pursuit gain was uniformly reduced at all target velocities at each frequency. This decrease in gain indicates that dysfunction of the gain element, rather than abnormal drop acceleration saturation is responsible for impaired smooth pursuit. The results indicate that Parkinson's disease damages structures involved in the regulation of the saccadic and pursuit systems. We infer that nigrostriatal pathways, known to be damaged in Parkinson's disease, control the latency, velocity and amplitude of saccades, and the gain element of smooth pursuit},

	abstract = {Eye and head movements were analysed during smooth pursuit in 16 patients with various forms of cerebellar disease. Smooth pursuit gain was reduced across all frequencies and velocities of target motion for the patient group as a whole, during both sinusoidal and pseudo-random target motion. The graded breakdown in the pursuit response, as pseudo-random target motion became less predictable, was of a similar magnitude in patients and controls, implying that the predictive pursuit mechanisms were intact in these patients. During head-free pursuit, when vestibulo-ocular reflex ({VOR}) suppression was necessary, performance was not significantly different from that observed during head-fixed pursuit in the patient group. This finding is similar to that noted in control subjects, and is consistent with the observation that the {VOR} gains associated with head movements in darkness were similar in the patient and control groups. The deficits in pursuit and {VOR} suppression in patients with cerebellar disease therefore represent a decrease in gain in the closed-loop visual feedback pathways with apparent sparing of the predictive pathways.},

	abstract = {The brain maintains the accuracy of saccadic eye movements by adjusting saccadic amplitude relative to the target distance (i.e., saccade gain) on the basis of the performance of recent saccades. If an experimenter surreptitiously moves the target backward during each saccade, thereby causing the eyes to land beyond their targets, saccades undergo a gradual gain reduction. The error signal driving this conventional saccadic gain adaptation could be either visual (the postsaccadic distance of the target from the fovea) or motoric (the direction and size of the corrective saccade that brings the eye onto the back-stepped target). Similarly, the adaptation itself might be a motor adjustment (change in the size of saccade for a given perceived target distance) or a visual remapping (change in the perceived target distance). We studied these possibilities in experiments both with rhesus macaques and with humans. To test whether the error signal is motoric, we used a paradigm devised by Heiner Deubel. The Deubel paradigm differed from the conventional adaptation paradigm in that the backward step that occurred during the saccade was brief, and the target then returned to its original displaced location. This ploy replaced most of the usual backward corrective saccades with forward ones. Nevertheless, saccadic gain gradually decreased over hundreds of trials. Therefore, we conclude that the direction of saccadic gain adaptation is not determined by the direction of corrective saccades. To test whether gain adaptation is a manifestation of a static visual remapping, we decreased the gain of 10 degrees horizontal saccades by conventional adaptation and then tested the gain to targets appearing at retinal locations unused during adaptation. To make the target appear in such "virgin territory," we had it jump first vertically and then 10 degrees horizontally; both jumps were completed and the target spot extinguished before saccades were made sequentially to the remembered target locations. Conventional adaptation decreased the gain of the second, horizontal saccade even though the target was in a nonadapted retinal location. In contrast, the horizontal component of oblique saccades made directly to the same virgin location showed much less gain decrease, suggesting that the adaptation is specific to saccade direction rather than to target location. Thus visual remapping cannot account for the entire reduction of saccadic gain. We conclude that saccadic gain adaptation involves an error signal that is primarily visual, not motor, but that the adaptation itself is primarily motor, not visual.},

	volume = {78},
	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {In a series of experiments, we examined the increase in saccade latency that is observed consistently when distractor stimuli are presented simultaneously with the saccade target at various nontarget locations. In the first experiment, targets and distractors were presented on the horizontal axis. We found that saccade latency was increased when distractors appeared at fixation and in the contralateral nontarget hemifield (at eccentricities  or = 10 degrees). In contrast, latency was unaffected by distractors presented along the ipsilateral target axis, but amplitude was increased as saccades tended to land at intermediate locations between the two stimuli (global effect). The effect of presenting distractors at various two-dimensional locations in both the target and nontarget hemifields then was examined, and the maximum latency increase again was observed when distractors appeared at fixation. Distractors presented on any of the eight principal axes in either hemifield, other than on the horizontal target axis, also increased latency. The relationship between the effects of distractors on latency and amplitude was reciprocal. Within approximately 20 degrees of the target axis itself, distractors affected saccade amplitude but not latency. In contrast, distractors presented outside this "window" increased saccade latency without affecting amplitude. A systematic quantitative relationship was revealed between the increase in latency and the ratio between target and distractor eccentricities. The latency increase was largest with small values of the ratio and reached a peak with distractors at the fixation location. The finding that the increase observed for more eccentric distractor locations fitted the same function as that at fixation shows that inhibitory effects operate over large areas of the visual field. The increase in latency under distractor conditions is interpreted in light of recent neurophysiological findings of inhibitory processes operating in the rostral region of the superior colliculus. Our results suggest that these inhibitory processes are not restricted to the central foveal region alone but operate over wider regions of the visual field.},

	volume = {80},
	issn = {0022-3077},
	abstract = {To examine how the periarcuate area is involved in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements, we recorded 177 single neurons while monkeys pursued a moving target in the dark. The majority (52\%, 92/177) of task-related neurons responded to pursuit but had little or no response to saccades. Histological reconstructions showed that these neurons were located mainly in the posterior bank of the arcuate sulcus near the sulcal spur. Twenty-seven percent (48/177) changed their activity at the onset of saccades. Of these, 36 (75\%) showed presaccadic burst activity with strong preference for contraversive saccades. Eighteen (10\%, 18/177) were classified as eye-position-related neurons, and 11\% (19/177) were related to other aspects of the stimuli or response. Among the 92 neurons that responded to pursuit, 85 (92\%) were strongly directional with uniformly distributed preferred directions. Further analyses were performed in these directionally sensitive pursuit-related neurons. For 59 neurons that showed distinct changes in activity around the initiation of pursuit, the median latency from target motion was 96 ms and that preceding pursuit was -12 ms, indicating that these neuron can influence the initiation of pursuit. We tested some neurons by briefly extinguishing the tracking target (n = 39) or controlling its movement with the eye position signal (n = 24). The distribution of the change in pursuit-related activity was similar to previous data for the dorsomedial part of the medial superior temporal neurons (, indicating that pursuit-related neurons in the periarcuate area also carry extraretinal signals. For 22 neurons, we examined the responses when the animals reversed pursuit direction to distinguish the effects of eye acceleration in the preferred direction from oppositely directed eye velocity. Almost all neurons discharged before eye velocity reached zero, however, only nine neurons discharged before the eyes were accelerated in the preferred direction. The delay in neuronal responses relative to the onset of eye acceleration in these trials might be caused by suppression from oppositely directed pursuit velocity. The results suggest that the periarcuate neurons do not participate in the earliest stage of eye acceleration during the change in pursuit direction, although most of them may participate in the early stages of pursuit initiation in the ordinary step-ramp pursuit trials. Some neurons changed their activity when the animals fixated a stationary target, and this activity could be distinguished easily from the strong pursuit-related responses. Our results suggest that the periarcuate pursuit area carries extraretinal signals and affects the premotor circuitry for smooth pursuit.},

	abstract = {We investigated the capacity of 6 humans to make voluntary smooth eye movements with a horizontally stabilized foveal point target. When the target was viewed on a dark field, all subjects were able to make smooth oscillatory eye movements when they attempted to imitate their own normal pursuit of sinusoidal target movement (0.2-0.7 Hz) directly preceding the stabilization on the fovea. The frequency of the imitating eye movement was in general lower than the frequency of normal pursuit by 2-35\%. While fixating a foveally stabilized point target superimposed on a large, sinusoidally moving non-stabilized background, all subjects were able to make either no eye movements, eye movements nearly in phase with or eye movements nearly in counterphase with the background movement depending on the instruction to imagine the target as head-stationary, moving in phase, or moving in counterphase with the background. The accuracy of the frequency of the smooth eye movement with the stabilized target on the moving background was higher than during imitation of pursuit on the dark field but the precision of the frequency was lower than during normal pursuit. When the background moved pseudo-randomly all subjects could voluntarily inhibit their smooth eye movements or could make smooth eye movements in phase with the background. Only 2 subjects showed a limited ability to make smooth eye movements opposite to the pseudo-random background movement. The results suggest that with predictable background movement the volition of the subject rather than the movement of the background determines the eye movements when the subject looks at the foveally stabilized target.},

	abstract = {Anterograde tracing methods were used to examine the topographic organization and interrelationship of projections to the neostriatum arising from various areas of association cortex. In contrast to the currently accepted topographic schema, all cortical areas examined project to longitudinal territories that occupy restricted medial-lateral domains of the neostriatum. The posterior parietal and superior arcuate cortices project to dorsolateral portions of the neostriatum; the dorsolateral and dorsomedial frontal cortices project centrally; and the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and superior temporal projections are distributed to ventromedial regions of the caudate nucleus and putamen. In coronal section, cortical terminal fields form a diagonal strip, extending from the dorsal, ventricular border of the caudate nucleus, through the fiber bundles of the internal capsule, to the ventral margin of the putamen. Double labeling studies, in which two cortical areas were injected in the same animal, indicated that convergence of input within neostriatal domains is not governed by reciprocity of corticocortical connectivity. Thus, the interrelationship of projections arising from connectionally linked cortical areas ranged from nearly complete segregation of terminal fields (e.g., from dorsolateral prefrontal and orbital cortices) to extensive overlap of terminal domains (e.g., from frontal and temporal cortices). In the latter case, detailed analysis revealed that frontal and temporal terminals actually were interdigitated rather than intermixed within the zone of overlap. The present findings suggest a new conceptualization of corticostriatal topography in the primate which emphasizes the longitudinal arrangement of cortical terminal domains. Additionally, these findings provide a map for functional parcellation of the neostriatum on the basis of its cortical innervation which may prove useful to understanding normal striatal function, as well as the symptomatology associated with neostriatal injury and disease.},

	abstract = {Dodge, in 1903, was among the first to draw a distinction between saccadic and smooth pursuit human eye movements. Saccadic movements have attracted much attention because they reflect the most rapid activity of a very fast mammalian skeletal muscle. Smooth pursuit movements, however, constitute a large portion of ocular activity and while some des-criptions of them exist (Rashbass, 1961; Westheimer, 1954) and some theories have been proposed on their integration into ocular target-following (Young \& Stark, 1963), a more thorough examination of them and their concomitant muscular activity seems desirable as a preface to further investigations into the oculomotor system. The experiments reported here elucidate the nature of the net active state tension in the horizontal recti that accelerates the eye in smooth pursuit move-ments from one velocity to another in about 130 msec. These experiments also indicate that the sampled data system analogy of eye movements proposed by Young \& Stark (1963), while quite successful for saccadic movements, seems not pertinent to the smooth pursuit system for which the stimulus-response relation appears to be continuous in nature. {METHODS} Eye movements and the net isometric tension of the horizontal recti were measured while subjects visually followed horizontally moving targets. Eye movements were measured by the method of a scleral search coil in a magnetic field (Robinson, 1963). Briefly, the subject wears a suction scleral contact lens containing two coils of wire and is exposed to two altemating magnetic fields in spatial and phase quadrature. Voltages induced in these coils, when processed through electronic phase detectors, give rise to three signals pro-portional to the horizontal, vertical and torsional components of eye position. The device has a sensitivity of 15 seconds of arc and a band width of 1000 c/s.},

	abstract = {The degree of parallel processing in frontal cortex-basal ganglia circuits is a central and debated issue in research on the basal ganglia. To approach this issue directly, we analyzed and compared the corticostriatal projections of two principal oculomotor areas of the frontal lobes, the frontal eye field ({FEF}) and the supplementary eye field ({SEF}). We first identified cortical regions within or adjacent to each eye field by microstimulation in macaque monkeys and then injected each site with either 35S-methionine or {WGA}-{HRP} conjugate. We analyzed the corticostriatal projections and also the interconnections of the pairs of cortical areas. We observed major convergence of the projections of the {FEF} and the {SEF} within the striatum, principally in the caudate nucleus. In cross sections through the striatum, both projections were broken into a series of discontinuous input zones that seemed to be part of complex three-dimensional labyrinths. Where the {FEF} and {SEF} projection fields were both present, they overlapped patch for patch. Thus, both inputs were dispersed within the striatum but converged with one another. Striatal afferents from cortex adjacent to the {FEF} and the {SEF} did not show convergence with {SEF} and {FEF} inputs, but did, in part, converge with one another. For all pairs of cortical areas tested, the degree of overlap in the corticostriatal projections appeared to be directly correlated with the degree of cortical interconnectivity of the areas injected. All of the corticostriatal fiber projections observed primarily avoided immunohistochemically identified striosomes. We conclude that there is convergence of oculomotor information from two distinct regions of the frontal cortex to the striatal matrix, which is known to project into pallidonigral circuits including the striatonigrocollicular pathway of the saccadic eye movement system. Furthermore, functionally distinct premotor areas near the oculomotor fields often systematically projected to striatal zones adjacent to oculomotor field projections, suggesting an anatomical basis for potential interaction of these inputs within the striatum. We propose that parallel processing is not the exclusive principle of organization of forebrain circuits associated with the basal ganglia. Rather, patterns of both convergence and divergence are present and are likely to depend on multiple functional and developmental constraints.},

	abstract = {Step-ramp target motion evokes a characteristic sequence of presaccadic smooth eye movement in the direction of the target ramp, catch-up targets to bring eye position close to the position of the moving target, and postsaccadic eye velocities that nearly match target velocity. I have analyzed this sequence of eye movements in monkeys to reveal a strong postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit eye velocity and to document the conditions that lead to that enhancement. Smooth eye velocity was measured in the last 10 ms before and the first 10 ms after the first saccade evoked by step-ramp target motion. Plots of eye velocity as a function of time after the onset of the target ramp revealed that eye velocity at a given time was much higher if measured after versus before the saccade. Postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit was recorded consistently when the target stepped 3 degrees eccentric on the horizontal axis and moved upward, downward, or away from the position of fixation. To determine whether postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit was invoked by smear of the visual scene during a saccade, I recorded the effect of simulated saccades on the presaccadic eye velocity for step-ramp target motion. The 3 degrees simulated saccade, which consisted of motion of a textured background at 150 degrees/s for 20 ms, failed to cause any enhancement of presaccadic eye velocity. By using a strategically selected set of oblique target steps with horizontal ramp target motion, I found clear enhancement for saccades in all directions, even those that were orthogonal to target motion. When the size of the target step was varied by up to 15 degrees along the horizontal meridian, postsaccadic eye velocity did not depend strongly either on the initial target position or on whether the target moved toward or away from the position of fixation. In contrast, earlier studies and data in this paper show that presaccadic eye velocity is much stronger when the target is close to the center of the visual field and when the target moves toward versus away from the position of fixation. I suggest that postsaccadic enhancement of pursuit reflects activation, by saccades, of a switch that regulates the strength of transmission through the visual-motor pathways for pursuit. Targets can cause strong visual motion signals but still evoke low presaccadic eye velocities if they are ineffective at activating the pursuit system.},

	abstract = {The visual input for pursuit eye movements is represented in the cerebral cortex as the distributed activity of neurons that are tuned for both the direction and speed of target motion. To probe how the motor system uses this distributed code to compute a command for smooth eye movements, we have recorded the initiation of pursuit for 150 msec presentations of two spots moving at different speeds and/or in different directions. With equal probability, one of the two spots continued to move at the same speed and in the same direction and became the tracking target, whereas the other disappeared and served as a distractor. We measured eye acceleration in the interval from 110 to 206 msec after the onset of spot motion, within both the open-loop interval for pursuit and the interval during which eye motion was affected by the two spots. Our results demonstrate that weighted vector averaging is used to combine the responses to two moving spots. We found only a minute number of responses that were consistent with either vector summation or winner-take-all computations. In addition, our data show that it is difficult for the monkey to defeat vector averaging without extended training on the use of an explicit cue about which spot will become the target. We argue that our experiment reveals the computations done by the pursuit system in the absence of attentional bias and that vector averaging is normally used to read the distributed code of image motion when there is only one target.},

	abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements allow primates to fixate and track small, slowly moving objects. Pursuit usually requires visual targets; our aim was to determine the properties of the visual signals transmitted to the pursuit motor system. Rhesus monkeys were rewarded for tracking spots of light that underwent discreet changes in velocity under a variety of visual conditions. We measured the resulting smooth eye acceleration in a 100-msec interval that began with the initiation of pursuit and ended before there had been time for visual feedback. This approach allowed us to vary the parameters of visual stimulation and measure eye movement responses in a way that provides estimates of the properties of signals transmitted by visual pathways. The initiation of pursuit showed different properties early and late in the interval we studied. In the first 20 msec of pursuit, eye acceleration was in the correct direction, but was independent of the initial position of the moving images, the velocity of the stimulus, or the presence or absence of background illumination. Thereafter, the initiation of pursuit depended strongly on all of the above parameters. Eye acceleration was highest when the moving images fell close to the fovea and decreased sharply as eccentricity was increased up to 21 degrees. When the background was diffusely illuminated, eye acceleration showed velocity selectivity; it was highest for a middle range of velocities (30 to 60 degrees/sec) and decreased for higher velocities. When the background was dark, eye acceleration increased as a function of target velocity up to 150 degrees/sec. We conclude that the initiation of pursuit has at least 2 visual components. The two components have different latencies and show quite different relationships to the visual properties of the stimulus, suggesting two cell populations that could provide the visual inputs for pursuit.},

The patch was then switched to the paretic eye and the gain decreased, with a time constant of 0.85 day. The patch was then switched to the paretic eye and the gain decreased, with a time constant of 1.54 days. This demonstrated central nervous system plasticity of the pulse and step of neural activity responsible for the generation of saccades in the adult human. In addition to gain changes, postsaccadic drift velocity and saccadic velocity/amplitude relationship alterations during the patching are reported.

	abstract = {Abstract â In an environment that is temporal as well as spatial in nature, the nervous system of agents needs to deal with various forms of delay, internal or external. Neural (or internal) delay can cause serious problems because by the time the central nervous system receives an input from the periphery, the environmental state is already updated. To be in touch with reality in the present rather than in the past, such a delay has to be compensated. Our observation is that facilitatory dynamics found in synapses can effectively deal with delay by activating in an extrapolatory mode. The idea was tested in a modified 2D pole-balancing problem which included sensory delays. Within this domain, we tested the behavior of recurrent neural networks with facilitatory neural dynamics trained via neuroevolution. Analysis of the performance and the evolved network parameters showed that, under various forms of delay, networks utilizing facilitatory dynamics are at a significant competitive advantage compared to networks with other dynamics.},

	abstract = {Significant progress has been made within the last decade in motor cortical decoding that predicts movement behaviors from population neuronal activity in the motor cortex. A majority of these decoding methods have focused on estimating a subject's hand trajectory in a continuous movement. We recently proposed a time identification decoding approach and showed that if a stereotyped movement is well represented by a sequence of targets (or landmarks), then the main structure of the movement can be reconstructed by detecting the reaching times at those targets. Both trajectory decoding and landmark-time decoding have their particular advantages, whereas a coupling of these two different strategies has not been examined. In this article we propose a synergy that comes from combining these two approaches for a stereotyped movement under a linear state-space framework. We develop a new decoding procedure based on a forward-backward propagation where the target is used in the initial stage in the backward step. Experimental results show that the new method significantly improves decoding accuracy over the non-target-included models. Furthermore, the coupling based on the new target-included method effectively combines the time decoding and trajectory decoding and further improves the decoding accuracy. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements are evoked by retinal image motion of visible moving objects and can also be driven by the internal representation of a target due to extraretinal mechanisms (e.g. efference copy). To delineate the corresponding neuronal correlates, functional magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T was applied during smooth pursuit at 10 degrees /s with continuous target presentation and target blanking for 1 s to 16 right-handed healthy males. Eye movements were assessed during scanning sessions by infra-red reflection oculography. Smooth pursuit performance was optimal when the target was visible but decreased to a residual velocity of about 30\% of the velocity observed during continuous target presentation. Random effects analysis of the imaging data yielded an activation pattern for smooth pursuit in the absence of a visual target (in contrast to continuous target presentation) which included a number of cortical areas in which extraretinal information is available such as the frontal eye field, the superior parietal lobe, the anterior and the posterior intraparietal sulcus and the premotor cortex, and also the supplementary and the presupplementary eye field, the supramarginal gyrus, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, cerebellar areas and the basal ganglia. We suggest that cortical mechanisms such as prediction, visuo-spatial attention and transformation, multimodal visuomotor control and working memory are of special importance for maintaining smooth pursuit eye movements in the absence of a visible target.},

	abstract = {Decision making in an uncertain environment poses a conflict between the opposing demands of gathering and exploiting information. In a classic illustration of this 'exploration-exploitation' dilemma, a gambler choosing between multiple slot machines balances the desire to select what seems, on the basis of accumulated experience, the richest option, against the desire to choose a less familiar option that might turn out more advantageous (and thereby provide information for improving future decisions). Far from representing idle curiosity, such exploration is often critical for organisms to discover how best to harvest resources such as food and water. In appetitive choice, substantial experimental evidence, underpinned by computational reinforcement learning ({RL}) theory, indicates that a dopaminergic, striatal and medial prefrontal network mediates learning to exploit. In contrast, although exploration has been well studied from both theoretical and ethological perspectives, its neural substrates are much less clear. Here we show, in a gambling task, that human subjects' choices can be characterized by a computationally well-regarded strategy for addressing the explore/exploit dilemma. Furthermore, using this characterization to classify decisions as exploratory or exploitative, we employ functional magnetic resonance imaging to show that the frontopolar cortex and intraparietal sulcus are preferentially active during exploratory decisions. In contrast, regions of striatum and ventromedial prefrontal cortex exhibit activity characteristic of an involvement in value-based exploitative decision making. The results suggest a model of action selection under uncertainty that involves switching between exploratory and exploitative behavioural modes, and provide a computationally precise characterization of the contribution of key decision-related brain systems to each of these functions.},

	abstract = {This paper assumes that cortical circuits have evolved to enable inference about the causes of sensory input received by the brain. This provides a principled specification of what neural circuits have to achieve. Here, we attempt to address how the brain makes inferences by casting inference as an optimisation problem. We look at how the ensuing recognition dynamics could be supported by directed connections and message-passing among neuronal populations, given our knowledge of intrinsic and extrinsic neuronal connections. We assume that the brain models the world as a dynamic system, which imposes causal structure on the sensorium. Perception is equated with the optimisation or inversion of this internal model, to explain sensory input. Given a model of how sensory data are generated, we use a generic variational approach to model inversion to furnish equations that prescribe recognition; i.e., the dynamics of neuronal activity that represents the causes of sensory input. Here, we focus on a model whose hierarchical and dynamical structure enables simulated brains to recognise and predict sequences of sensory states. We first review these models and their inversion under a variational free-energy formulation. We then show that the brain has the necessary infrastructure to implement this inversion and present stimulations using synthetic birds that generate and recognise birdsongs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Convincing evidence shows that high-level motion perception–which is driven by top-down processes such as attentional tracking or inferred motion–can influence the perceived position of an object. Is high-level motion sufficient to influence perceived position, and is attention to or awareness of motion direction necessary to displace objects' perceived positions? Consistent with previous reports, the first experiment revealed that the perception of motion, even when no physical motion was present, was sufficient to shift perceived position. A second experiment showed that when subjects were unable to identify the direction of a physically present motion stimulus, the apparent locations of other objects were still influenced. Thus, motion influences perceived position by at least two distinct processes. The first involves a passive, preattentive mechanism that does not depend on perceptual awareness; the second, a top-down process that depends on the perceptual awareness of motion direction. Each contributes to perceived position, but independently of the other.},

Neurophysiological data obtained with paralyzed eyes suggest that this coarse-to-fine sequence results from spatiotemporal filtering by neurons in the early visual pathway. However, the eyes are normally never stationary: rapid gaze shifts (saccades) incessantly alternate with slow fixational movements. To investigate the consequences of this oculomotor cycle on the dynamics of perception, we combined spectral analysis of visual input signals, neural modeling, and gaze-contingent control of retinal stimulation in humans. We show that the saccade/fixation cycle reformats the flow impinging on the retina in a way that initiates coarse-to-fine processing at each fixation. This finding reveals that the visual system uses oculomotor-induced temporal modulations to sequentially encode different spatial components and suggests that, rather than initiating coarse-to-fine processing, spatiotemporal coupling in the early visual pathway builds on the information dynamics of the oculomotor cycle.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Delays are a natural consequence of temporal summation and coding used by the nervous system to integrate information from multiple resources. For adaptive behaviour, however, these delays must be compensated. In order to sense and interact with moving objects, for example, the visual system must predict the future position of the object to compensate for delays. In this paper, we address two critical questions concerning the implementation of the compensation mechanisms in the brain, namely, where does compensation occur and how is it realized. We present evidence showing that compensation can happen in both the motor and sensory systems, and that compensation using 'diagonal neural pathways' is a suitable strategy for implementing compensation in the visual system. In this strategy, neural signals in the early stage of information processing are sent to the future cortical positions that correspond to the distance the object will travel in the period of transmission delay. We propose a computational model to elucidate this using the retinal visual information pathway.},

	abstract = {Contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation and contextual modulation of primary visual cortex (V1) neuron responses to stimulation of their receptive field reveal long-distance integration of visual signals within V1, well beyond the classical receptive field ({cRF}) of single neurons. To identify the cortical circuits mediating these long-distance computations, we have used a combination of anatomical and physiological recording methods to determine the spatial scale and retinotopic logic of intra-areal V1 horizontal connections and inter-areal feedback connections to V1. We have then compared the spatial scales of these connectional systems to the spatial dimensions of the {cRF}, spatial summation field ({SF}), and modulatory surround field of macaque V1 neurons. We find that monosynaptic horizontal connections within area V1 are of an appropriate spatial scale to mediate interactions within the {SF} of V1 neurons and to underlie contrast-dependent changes in {SF} size. Contrary to common beliefs, these connections cannot fully account for the dimensions of the surround field. The spatial scale of feedback circuits from extrastriate cortex to V1 is, instead, commensurate with the full spatial range of center-surround interactions. Thus these connections could represent an anatomical substrate for contextual modulation and global-to-local integration of visual signals. Feedback projections connect corresponding and equal-sized regions of the visual field in striate and extrastriate cortices and cover anisotropic parts of visual space, unlike V1 horizontal connections that are isotropic in the macaque. V1 isotropic connectivity demonstrates that anisotropic horizontal connections are not necessary to generate orientation selectivity. Anisotropic feedback connections may play a role in contour completion.},

Here we show that it similarly compensated for other smoothly changing features. A disk was flashed briefly during the presentation of another disk of continuously changing color, and observers compared the colors of the disks at the moment of flash. We also tested luminance, spatial frequency and pattern entropy; for all features, the continuously changing item led the flashed item in feature space. Thus the visual system's ability to compensate for delays in information about a continuously changing stimulus may extend to all features.

	abstract = {The brain continuously maintains a current representation of its immediate surroundings. Perceptual representations are often updated when the world changes, e.g., when we notice an object move. However, we can also update representations internally, without incoming signals from the senses. In other words, we can run internal simulations of dynamic events. This ability is evident during mental object rotation. These uncontroversial observations lead to an obvious question that nevertheless remains to be answered: How does the brain control the speed of dynamic mental simulations? Is there a central rate controller or pacemaker module in the brain that can be temporarily coupled to sensory maps? We can refer to this as the common rate control theory. Alternatively, the primitive intelligence within each map could tune into the speed of recent changes and use this information to keep going after stimuli disappear. We can call this the separate rate control theory. Preliminary evidence from prediction motion experiments supports common rate control, although local predictive mechanisms may cover short gaps of {\textless}200ms. The putative rate controller might turn out to be the same thing as the velocity store described in smooth pursuit eye movement models and/or the pacemaker module proposed in the cognitive timing literature. Indirect neuroimaging evidence suggests rate control is a function of the core timing system in the dorsal striatum.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This paper considers neuronal architectures from a computational perspective and asks what aspects of neuroanatomy and neurophysiology can be disclosed by the nature of neuronal computations? In particular, we extend current formulations of the brain as an organ of inference—based upon hierarchical predictive coding—and consider how these inferences are orchestrated. In other words, what would the brain require to dynamically coordinate and contextualize its message passing to optimize its computational goals? The answer that emerges rests on the delicate (modulatory) gain control of neuronal populations that select and coordinate (prediction error) signals that ascend cortical hierarchies. This is important because it speaks to a hierarchical anatomy of extrinsic (between region) connections that form two distinct classes, namely a class of driving (first-order) connections that are concerned with encoding the content of neuronal representations and a class of modulatory (second-order) connections that establish context—in the form of the salience or \textit{precision} ascribed to content. We explore the implications of this distinction from a formal perspective (using simulations of feature–ground segregation) and consider the neurobiological substrates of the ensuing precision-engineered dynamics, with a special focus on the pulvinar and attention.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Slow oscillatory activity ({\textless}1 Hz) is observed in vivo in the cortex during slow-wave sleep or under anesthesia and in vitro when the bath solution is chosen to more closely mimic cerebrospinal fluid. Here we present a biophysical network model for the slow oscillations observed in vitro that reproduces the single neuron behaviors and collective network firing patterns in control as well as under pharmacological manipulations. The membrane potential of a neuron oscillates slowly (at {\textless}1 Hz) between a down state and an up state; the up state is maintained by strong recurrent excitation balanced by inhibition, and the transition to the down state is due to a slow adaptation current (Na(+)-dependent K(+) current). Consistent with in vivo data, the input resistance of a model neuron, on average, is the largest at the end of the down state and the smallest during the initial phase of the up state. An activity wave is initiated by spontaneous spike discharges in a minority of neurons, and propagates across the network at a speed of 3-8 mm/s in control and 20-50 mm/s with inhibition block. Our work suggests that long-range excitatory patchy connections contribute significantly to this wave propagation. Finally, we show with this model that various known physiological effects of neuromodulation can switch the network to tonic firing, thus simulating a transition to the waking state.},

All stimuli were equiluminant so that constrictions in pupillary size could not be ascribed to changes in light energy. We found that the pupillary diameter rapidly varied according to perceived brightness and lightness strength. Differences in local contrast information could be ruled out as an explanation because, in a second experiment, the observers maintained eye fixation in the center of the display; thus, differential stimulation of the fovea by local contrast changes could not be responsible for the pupillary differences. Hence, the most parsimonious explanation for the present findings is that pupillary responses to ambient light reflect the perceived brightness or lightness of the scene and not simply the amount of physical light energy entering the eye. Thus, the pupillary physiological response reflects the subjective perception of light and supports the idea that the brain's visual circuitry is shaped by visual experience with images and their possible sources.},

These results are concordant with the general idea that imagining or attending to an object is accompanied by projecting its image onto a neural map of object-centered space.

	abstract = {Learning is difficult when the world fluctuates randomly and ceaselessly. Classical learning algorithms, such as the delta rule with constant learning rate, are not optimal. Mathematically, the optimal learning rule requires weighting prior knowledge and incoming evidence according to their respective reliabilities. This "confidence weighting" implies the maintenance of an accurate estimate of the reliability of what has been learned. Here, using {fMRI} and an ideal-observer analysis, we demonstrate that the brain's learning algorithm relies on confidence weighting. While in the {fMRI} scanner, human adults attempted to learn the transition probabilities underlying an auditory or visual sequence, and reported their confidence in those estimates. They knew that these transition probabilities could change simultaneously at unpredicted moments, and therefore that the learning problem was inherently hierarchical. Subjective confidence reports tightly followed the predictions derived from the ideal observer. In particular, subjects managed to attach distinct levels of confidence to each learned transition probability, as required by Bayes-optimal inference. Distinct brain areas tracked the likelihood of new observations given current predictions, and the confidence in those predictions. Both signals were combined in the right inferior frontal gyrus, where they operated in agreement with the confidence-weighting model. This brain region also presented signatures of a hierarchical process that disentangles distinct sources of uncertainty. Together, our results provide evidence that the sense of confidence is an essential ingredient of probabilistic learning in the human brain, and that the right inferior frontal gyrus hosts a confidence-based statistical learning algorithm for auditory and visual sequences.},

Our model is substantiated by discussing four different brain mechanisms that play a key role in religion and spirituality: temporal brain areas are associated with religious visions and ecstatic experiences; multisensory brain areas and the default mode network are involved in self-transcendent experiences; the Theory of Mind-network is associated with prayer experiences and over attribution of intentionality; top-down mechanisms instantiated in the anterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex could be involved in acquiring and maintaining intuitive supernatural beliefs. We compare the predictive processing model with two-systems accounts of religion and spirituality, by highlighting the central role of prediction error monitoring. We conclude by presenting novel predictions for future research and by discussing the philosophical and theological implications of neuroscientific research on religion and spirituality.},

	abstract = {Many of our cognitive capacities are the result of enculturation. Enculturation is the temporally extended transformative acquisition of cognitive practices in the cognitive niche. Cognitive practices are embodied and normatively constrained ways to interact with epistemic resources in the cognitive niche in order to complete a cognitive task. The emerging predictive processing perspective offers new functional principles and conceptual tools to account for the cerebral and extra-cerebral bodily components that give rise to cognitive practices. According to this emerging perspective, many cases of perception, action, and cognition are realized by the on-going minimization of prediction error. Predictive processing provides us with a mechanistic perspective that helps investigate the functional details of the acquisition of cognitive practices. The argument of this paper is that research on enculturation and recent work on predictive processing are complementary. The main reason is that predictive processing operates at a sub-personal level and on a physiological time scale of explanation only. A complete account of enculturated cognition needs to take additional levels and temporal scales of explanation into account. This complementarity assumption leads to a new framework—enculturated predictive processing—that operates on multiple levels and temporal scales for the explanation of the enculturated predictive acquisition of cognitive practices. Enculturated predictive processing is committed to explanatory pluralism. That is, it subscribes to the idea that we need multiple perspectives and explanatory strategies to account for the complexity of enculturation. The upshot is that predictive processing needs to be complemented by additional considerations and conceptual tools to realize its full explanatory potential. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht},

	abstract = {Today, increasing attention is being paid to research into spike-based neural computation both to gain a better understanding of the brain and to explore biologically-inspired computation. Within this field, the primate visual pathway and its hierarchical organisation have been extensively studied. Spiking Neural Networks ({SNNs}), inspired by the understanding of observed biological structure and function, have been successfully applied to visual recognition and classification tasks. In addition, implementations on neuromorphic hardware have enabled large-scale networks to run in (or even faster than) real time, making spike-based neural vision processing accessible on mobile robots. Neuromorphic sensors such as silicon retinas are able to feed such mobile systems with real-time visual stimuli. A new set of vision benchmarks for spike-based neural processing are now needed to measure progress quantitatively within this rapidly advancing field. We propose that a large dataset of spike-based visual stimuli is needed to provide meaningful comparisons between different systems, and a corresponding evaluation methodology is also required to measure the performance of {SNN} models and their hardware implementations. In this paper we first propose an initial {NE} (Neuromorphic Engineering) dataset based on standard computer vision benchmarks and that uses digits from the {MNIST} database. This dataset is compatible with the state of current research on spike-based image recognition. The corresponding spike trains are produced using a range of techniques: rate-based Poisson spike generation, rank order encoding, and recorded output from a silicon retina with both flashing and oscillating input stimuli. In addition, a complementary evaluation methodology is presented to assess both model-level and hardware-level performance. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the dataset and the evaluation methodology using two {SNN} models to validate the performance of the models and their hardware implementations. With this dataset we hope to (1) promote meaningful comparison between algorithms in the field of neural computation, (2) allow comparison with conventional image recognition methods, (3) provide an assessment of the state of the art in spike-based visual recognition, and (4) help researchers identify future directions and advance the field.},

We discovered that place fields in hippocampal area {CA}1 are produced by a synaptic potentiation notably different from Hebbian plasticity. Place fields could be produced in vivo in a single trial by potentiation of input that arrived seconds before and after complex spiking. The potentiated synaptic input was not initially coincident with action potentials or depolarization. This rule, named behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity, abruptly modifies inputs that were neither causal nor close in time to postsynaptic activation. In slices, five pairings of subthreshold presynaptic activity and calcium (Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$) plateau potentials produced a large potentiation with an asymmetric seconds-long time course. This plasticity efficiently stores entire behavioral sequences within synaptic weights to produce predictive place cell activity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Surprise measures how data affects an observer, in terms of differences between posterior and prior beliefs about the world. Only data observations which substantially affect the observer's beliefs yield surprise, irrespectively of how rare or informative in Shannon's sense these observations are. We test the framework by quantifying the extent to which humans may orient attention and gaze towards surprising events or items while watching television. To this end, we implement a simple computational model where a low-level, sensory form of surprise is computed by simple simulated early visual neurons. Bayesian surprise is a strong attractor of human attention, with 72\% of all gaze shifts directed towards locations more surprising than the average, a figure rising to 84\% when focusing the analysis onto regions simultaneously selected by all observers. The proposed theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In particular, a prominent facet of this structure is that images can be described by a relatively sparse number of features. We designed a sparse coding algorithm biologically-inspired by the architecture of the primary visual cortex. We show here that coefficients of this representation exhibit a power-law distribution. For each image, the exponent of this distribution characterizes sparseness and varies from image to image. To investigate the role of this sparseness, we designed a new class of random textured stimuli with a controlled sparseness value inspired by measurements of natural images. Then, we provide with a method to synthesize random textures images with a given sparseness statistics that match that of some class of natural images and provide perspectives for their use in neurophysiology.},

	title = {{BrainFrame}: A heterogeneous accelerator platform for neuron simulations},
	abstract = {Objective: The advent of High-Performance Computing ({HPC}) in recent years has led to its increasing use in brain study through computational models. The scale and complexity of such models are constantly increasing, leading to challenging computational requirements. Even though modern {HPC} platforms can often deal with such challenges, the vast diversity of the modeling field does not permit for a single acceleration (or homogeneous) platform to effectively address the complete array of modeling requirements. Approach: In this paper we propose and build {BrainFrame}, a heterogeneous acceleration platform, incorporating three distinct acceleration technologies, a Dataflow Engine, a Xeon Phi and a {GP}-{GPU}. The {PyNN} framework is also integrated into the platform. As a challenging proof of concept, we analyze the performance of {BrainFrame} on different instances of a state-of-the-art neuron model, modeling the Inferior-Olivary Nucleus using a biophysically-meaningful, extended Hodgkin-Huxley representation. The model instances take into account not only the neuronal-network dimensions but also different network-connectivity circumstances that can drastically change application workload characteristics. Main results: The synthetic approach of three {HPC} technologies demonstrated that {BrainFrame} is better able to cope with the modeling diversity encountered. Our performance analysis shows clearly that the model directly affect performance and all three technologies are required to cope with all the model use cases. Significance: The {BrainFrame} framework is designed to transparently configure and select the appropriate back-end accelerator technology for use per simulation run. The {PyNN} integration provides a familiar bridge to the vast array of modeling work already conducted. Additionally it gives a clear roadmap for extending the platform support beyond the proof-of-concept, with improved usability and directly useful features to computational-neuroscience community, paving the way for wider adoption.},

For a proper validation of these models, an embodiment in a dynamic and rich sensory environment, where the model is exposed to a realistic sensory-motor task, is needed. Due to the complexity of these brain models that, at the current stage, cannot deal with real-time constraints, it is not possible to embed them into a real-world task. Rather, the embodiment has to be simulated as well. While adequate tools exist to simulate either complex neural networks or robots and their environments, there is so far no tool that allows to easily establish a communication between brain and body models. The Neurorobotics Platform is a new web-based environment that aims to fill this gap by offering scientists and technology developers a software infrastructure allowing them to connect brain models to detailed simulations of robot bodies and environments and to use the resulting neurorobotic systems for in silico experimentation. In order to simplify the workflow and reduce the level of the required programming skills, the platform provides editors for the specification of experimental sequences and conditions, environments, robots, and brain-body connectors. In addition to that, a variety of existing robots and environments are provided. This work presents the architecture of the first release of the Neurorobotics Platform developed in subproject 10 "Neurorobotics" of the Human Brain Project ({HBP}). At the current state, the Neurorobotics Platform allows researchers to design and run basic experiments in neurorobotics using simulated robots and simulated environments linked to simplified versions of brain models. We illustrate the capabilities of the platform with three example experiments: a Braitenberg task implemented on a mobile robot, a sensory-motor learning task based on a robotic controller, and a visual tracking embedding a retina model on the {iCub} humanoid robot. These use-cases allow to assess the applicability of the Neurorobotics Platform for robotic tasks as well as in neuroscientific experiments.},

	abstract = {We used speed discrimination tasks to measure the ability of observers to combine speed information from multiple stimuli distributed across space. We compared speed discrimination thresholds in a classical discrimination paradigm to those in an uncertainty/search paradigm. Thresholds were measured using a temporal two-interval forced-choice design. In the discrimination paradigm, the n gratings in each interval all moved at the same speed and observers were asked to choose the interval with the faster gratings. Discrimination thresholds for this paradigm decreased as the number of gratings increased. This decrease was not due to increasing the effective stimulus area as a control experiment that increased the area of a single grating did not show a similar improvement in thresholds. Adding independent speed noise to each of the n gratings caused thresholds to decrease at a rate similar to the original no-noise case, consistent with observers combining an independent sample of speed from each grating in both the added- and no-noise cases. In the search paradigm, observers were asked to choose the interval in which one of the n gratings moved faster. Thresholds in this case increased with the number of gratings, behavior traditionally attributed to an input bottleneck. However, results from the discrimination paradigm showed that the increase was not due to observers' inability to process these gratings. We have also shown that the opposite trends of the data in the two paradigms can be predicted by a decision theory model that combines independent samples of speed information across space. This demonstrates that models typically used in classical detection and discrimination paradigms are also applicable to search paradigms. As our model does not distinguish between samples in space and time, it predicts that discrimination performance should be the same regardless of whether the gratings are presented in two spatial intervals or two temporal intervals. Our last experiment largely confirmed this prediction. © 1995.},

	abstract = {There are significant neural transmission and processing delays within the nervous system. How then are behaviours observed both in nature and high-speed ball games, which require temporal accuracy to within several milliseconds, possible? Until recently, most investigators attributed the observed success in interceptive behaviours to learning or prediction built into motor programs that take these delays into account. Several investigators have proposed, however, that sensory mechanisms also contribute to compensation. Sensory compensation is particularly important when moving objects are the targets of interceptive behaviour, as in this case neural delays in the visual system could lead to errors in the communication of crucial position information of the object of interest. However, given the biological significance of visual motion the visual system could have evolved neural pathways optimized for the rapid transmission of motion signals. Alternatively, the visual system could take a sample of visual motion and compensate for the delays through prediction based on the sample. This mechanism is the visual analogue of the previously proposed internal forward model for motor control. We conducted four experiments using the flash-lag effect to ask if the nervous system is naturally geared to processing moving items with a speed greater than stationary flashes. Our results show that the nervous system does not process moving items more quickly than stationary flashes.},

Here we demonstrate that subjective estimates of uncertainty predict the dynamics of subjective and physiological stress responses. Subjects learned a probabilistic mapping between visual stimuli and electric shocks. Salivary cortisol confirmed that our stressor elicited changes in endocrine activity. Using a hierarchical Bayesian learning model, we quantified the relationship between the different forms of subjective task uncertainty and acute stress responses. Subjective stress, pupil diameter and skin conductance all tracked the evolution of irreducible uncertainty. We observed a coupling between emotional and somatic state, with subjective and physiological tuning to uncertainty tightly correlated. Furthermore, the uncertainty tuning of subjective and physiological stress predicted individual task performance, consistent with an adaptive role for stress in learning under uncertain threat. Our finding that stress responses are tuned to environmental uncertainty provides new insight into their generation and likely adaptive function.},

	abstract = {Computational theories of brain function have become very influential in neuroscience. They have facilitated the growth of formal approaches to disease, particularly in psychiatric research. In this paper, we provide a narrative review of the body of computational research addressing neuropsychological syndromes, and focus on those that employ Bayesian frameworks. Bayesian approaches to understanding brain function formulate perception and action as inferential processes. These inferences combine ‘prior' beliefs with a generative (predictive) model to explain the causes of sensations. Under this view, neuropsychological deficits can be thought of as false inferences that arise due to aberrant prior beliefs (that are poor fits to the real world). This draws upon the notion of a Bayes optimal pathology – optimal inference with suboptimal priors – and provides a means for computational phenotyping. In principle, any given neuropsychological disorder could be characterised by the set of prior beliefs that would make a patient's behaviour appear Bayes optimal. We start with an overview of some key theoretical constructs and use these to motivate a form of computational neuropsychology that relates anatomical structures in the brain to the computations they perform. Throughout, we draw upon computational accounts of neuropsychological syndromes. These are selected to emphasise the key features of a Bayesian approach, and the possible types of pathological prior that may be present. They range from visual neglect through hallucinations to autism. Through these illustrative examples, we review the use of Bayesian approaches to understand the link between biology and computation that is at the heart of neuropsychology.},

	abstract = {Maintaining appropriate beliefs about variables needed for effective decision making can be difficult in a dynamic environment. One key issue is the amount of influence that unexpected outcomes should have on existing beliefs. In general, outcomes that are unexpected because of a fundamental change in the environment should carry more influence than outcomes that are unexpected because of persistent environmental stochasticity. Here we use a novel task to characterize how well human subjects follow these principles under a range of conditions. We show that the influence of an outcome depends on both the error made in predicting that outcome and the number of similar outcomes experienced previously. We also show that the exact nature of these tendencies varies considerably across subjects. Finally, we show that these patterns of behavior are consistent with a computationally simple reduction of an ideal-observer model. The model adjusts the influence of newly experienced outcomes according to ongoing estimates of uncertainty and the probability of a fundamental change in the process by which outcomes are generated. A prior that quantifies the expected frequency of such environmental changes accounts for individual variability, including a positive relationship between subjective certainty and the degree to which new information influences existing beliefs. The results suggest that the brain adaptively regulates the influence of decision outcomes on existing beliefs using straightforward updating rules that take into account both recent outcomes and prior expectations about higher-order environmental structure.},

To avoid an accumulation of errors during sequences of saccades, a prediction derived from the efference copy can be combined with the reafferent visual feedback to adjust the following eye movement. By varying the information quantity of the visual feedback, we investigated how the reliability of the visual information affects the postsaccadic update in humans. Two elements of the visual scene were manipulated, the saccade target or the background, presented either together or in isolation. We determined the weight of the postsaccadic visual information by measuring the effect of intrasaccadic visual shifts on the following saccade. We confirmed that the weight of visual information evolves with information quantity as predicted for a statistically optimal system. In particular, we found that the visual background alone can guide the postsaccadic update, and that information from target and background are optimally combined. Moreover, these visual weights are adjusted dynamically and on a trial-to-trial basis to the level of visual noise determined by target eccentricity and reaction time. In contrast, we uncovered a dissociation between the visual signals used to update the next planned saccade (main saccade) and those used to generate an involuntary corrective saccade. The latter was exclusively based on visual information about the target, and discarded all information about the background: a suboptimal use of visual evidence.},

The framework, aimed at seamlessly generalizing error backpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron setting, is based strictly on spike timing and avoids invoking concepts pertaining to spike rates or probabilistic models of spiking. The derivation is founded on two innovations. First, an error functional is proposed that compares the spike train emitted by the output neuron of the network to the desired spike train by way of their putative impact on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps the need for spike alignment and leads to closed form solutions for all quantities of interest. Second, virtual assignment of weights to spikes rather than synapses enables a perturbation analysis of individual spike times and synaptic weights of the output as well as all intermediate neurons in the network, which yields the gradients of the error functional with respect to the said entities. Learning proceeds via a gradient descent mechanism that leverages these quantities. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed learning framework. The experiments also highlight asymmetries between synapses on excitatory and inhibitory neurons.},

Individual differences in perception should therefore be jointly determined by a person's sensitivity to incoming evidence and his or her prior expectations. It has been proposed that individuals with autism have flatter prior distributions than do nonautistic individuals, which suggests that prior variance is linked to the degree of autistic traits in the general population. We tested this idea by studying how perceived speed changes during pursuit eye movement and at low contrast. We found that individual differences in these two motion phenomena were predicted by differences in thresholds and autistic traits when combined in a quantitative Bayesian model. Our findings therefore support the flatter-prior hypothesis and suggest that individual differences in prior expectations are more systematic than previously thought.

Most investigations of this flash-lag effect ({FLE}) employ high velocity broadband stimuli, such as lines or dots with sharp boundaries and flashes with rapid onset and offset. We introduce a stimulus paradigm with narrow-band stimuli and measure the stimulus dependence of the {FLE} when basic stimulus parameters of spatio-temporal frequency and temporal duration are varied. We suggest that this dependence is consistent with the involvement of early visual mechanisms and interpret our results in the context of existing theories of the {FLE}. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Previous studies have shown that spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) can be used in spiking neural networks ({SNN}) to extract visual features of low or intermediate complexity in an unsupervised manner. These studies, however, used relatively shallow architectures, and only one layer was trainable. Another line of research has demonstrated – using rate-based neural networks trained with back-propagation – that having many layers increases the recognition robustness, an approach known as deep learning. We thus designed a deep {SNN}, comprising several convolutional (trainable with {STDP}) and pooling layers. We used a temporal coding scheme where the most strongly activated neurons fire first, and less activated neurons fire later or not at all. The network was exposed to natural images. Thanks to {STDP}, neurons progressively learned features corresponding to prototypical patterns that were both salient and frequent. Only a few tens of examples per category were required and no label was needed. After learning, the complexity of the extracted features increased along the hierarchy, from edge detectors in the first layer to object prototypes in the last layer. Coding was very sparse, with only a few thousands spikes per image, and in some cases the object category could be reasonably well inferred from the activity of a single higher-order neuron. More generally, the activity of a few hundreds of such neurons contained robust category information, as demonstrated using a classifier on Caltech 101, {ETH}-80, and {MNIST} databases. We also demonstrate the superiority of {STDP} over other unsupervised techniques such as random crops ({HMAX}) or auto-encoders. Taken together, our results suggest that the combination of {STDP} with latency coding may be a key to understanding the way that the primate visual system learns, its remarkable processing speed and its low energy consumption. These mechanisms are also interesting for artificial vision systems, particularly for hardware solutions.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question about the perception of time is whether the neural mechanisms underlying temporal judgements are universal and centralized in the brain or modality specific and distributed. Time perception has traditionally been thought to be entirely dissociated from spatial vision. Here we show that the apparent duration of a dynamic stimulus can be manipulated in a local region of visual space by adapting to oscillatory motion or flicker. This implicates spatially localized temporal mechanisms in duration perception. We do not see concomitant changes in the time of onset or offset of the test patterns, demonstrating a direct local effect on duration perception rather than an indirect effect on the time course of neural processing. The effects of adaptation on duration perception can also be dissociated from motion or flicker perception per se. Although 20 Hz adaptation reduces both the apparent temporal frequency and duration of a 10 Hz test stimulus, 5 Hz adaptation increases apparent temporal frequency but has little effect on duration perception. We conclude that there is a peripheral, spatially localized, essentially visual component involved in sensing the duration of visual events.},

However, comprehensive characterization of {RFs} beyond the primary visual cortex (V1) remains a challenge. Here we report fine {RF} structures in secondary visual cortex (V2) of awake macaque monkeys, identified through a projection pursuit regression analysis of neuronal responses to natural images. We found that V2 {RFs} could be broadly classified as V1-like (typical Gabor-shaped subunits), ultralong (subunits with high aspect ratios), or complex-shaped (subunits with multiple oriented components). Furthermore, single-unit recordings from functional domains identified by intrinsic optical imaging showed that neurons with ultralong {RFs} were primarily localized within pale stripes, whereas neurons with complex-shaped {RFs} were more concentrated in thin stripes. Thus, by combining single-unit recording with optical imaging and a computational approach, we identified {RF} subunits underlying spatial feature selectivity of V2 neurons and demonstrated the functional organization of these {RF} properties.},

Similar to previous findings in cat area 17, the spatial profile of simple-cell receptive fields in the macaque is well described by two-dimensional Gabor functions. A population analysis reveals that the distribution of spatial profiles in primary visual cortex lies approximately on a one-parameter family of filter shapes. Surprisingly, the receptive fields cluster into even- and odd-symmetry classes with a tendency for neurons that are well tuned in orientation and spatial frequency to have odd-symmetric receptive fields. The filter shapes predicted by two recent theories of simple-cell receptive field function, independent component analysis and sparse coding, are compared with the data. Both theories predict receptive fields with a larger number of subfields than observed in the experimental data. In addition, these theories do not generate receptive fields that are broadly tuned in orientation and low-pass in spatial frequency, which are commonly seen in monkey V1. The implications of these results for our understanding of image coding and representation in primary visual cortex are discussed.},

A simple form of this faculty based on spatial attentional orienting can be studied with Posner's location-cueing paradigm in which a cue indicates the target location with a known probability. The present study focuses on a more complex version of this task, where probabilistic context (percentage of cue validity) changes unpredictably over time, thereby creating a volatile environment. Saccadic response speed ({RS}) was recorded in 15 subjects and used to estimate subject-specific parameters of a Bayesian learning scheme modeling the subjects' trial-by-trial updates of beliefs. Different response models—specifying how computational states translate into observable behavior—were compared using Bayesian model selection. Saccadic {RS} was most plausibly explained as a function of the precision of the belief about the causes of sensory input. This finding is in accordance with current Bayesian theories of brain function, and specifically with the proposal that spatial attention is mediated by a precision-dependent gain modulation of sensory input. Our results provide empirical support for precision-dependent changes in beliefs about saccade target locations and motivate future neuroimaging and neuropharmacological studies of how Bayesian inference may determine spatial attention.},

Contrast-reversing stimuli elicit responses that oscillate at twice the stimulus frequency, indicating that signals originate mostly in complex cells. These responses stand clear of the noise, whose amplitude decreases as 1/frequency, and yield high-resolution maps of orientation preference and retinotopy. We first show how these maps are combined to yield the responses to focal, oriented stimuli. We then study the evolution of the oscillating activity in space and time. In the orientation domain, it is a standing wave. In the spatial domain, it is a traveling wave propagating at 0.2-0.5 m/s. These different dynamics indicate a fundamental distinction in the circuits underlying selectivity for position and orientation, two key stimulus attributes.},

However, beyond simple time differences, the way in which neurons might extract this information is unclear and the potential computational advantages are unknown. The computational difficulty of this task for an animal is to locate the source of an unexpected sound from two monaural signals that are highly dependent on the unknown source signal. In neuron models consisting of spectro-temporal filtering and spiking nonlinearity, we found that the binaural structure induced by spatialized sounds is mapped to synchrony patterns that depend on source location rather than on source signal. Location-specific synchrony patterns would then result in the activation of location-specific assemblies of postsynaptic neurons. We designed a spiking neuron model which exploited this principle to locate a variety of sound sources in a virtual acoustic environment using measured human head-related transfer functions. The model was able to accurately estimate the location of previously unknown sounds in both azimuth and elevation (including front/back discrimination) in a known acoustic environment. We found that multiple representations of different acoustic environments could coexist as sets of overlapping neural assemblies which could be associated with spatial locations by Hebbian learning. The model demonstrates the computational relevance of relative spike timing to extract spatial information about sources independently of the source signal.},

It is found that the threshold varies roughly as the inverse square root of the number of available basic dot correlation pairs, subject to certain constraints that can be interpreted as due to the geometry of basic correlator units subserving the detection of motion. This geometry is estimated from the data and compared with values that have been obtained with independent methods. Phenomenologically the results are simple: when the target field is enlarged in the direction perpendicular to the motion the {SNR} threshold follows the theoretical expectations. Otherwise the variation is stronger, which points to a recruitment of new units. For an impression of movement to occur the smallest targets are short thin strips elongated in the direction of motion (e.g. 2.5??? ?? 12??? for 2.08 deg sec-1), but the threshold continues to fall at least to 5?? ?? 5??. There is a trade-off between target area and presentation time. For a 5?? ?? 5?? target coherent motion can be seen in 3 successive frames, but for a 10??? ?? 10??? target ten times as many frames have to be presented, whereas an impression of movement is not obtained for still smaller targets. ?? 1984.},

Anticipatory behavior is required because of significant delays in transforming sensory information about target and body motion into a timed motor response. The ability to predict the kinematics and kinetics of interception or avoidance hundreds of milliseconds before the event may depend on several different sources of information and on different strategies of sensory-motor coordination. What are exactly the sources of spatio-temporal information and what are the control strategies remain controversial issues. Indeed, these topics have been the battlefield of contrasting views on how the brain interprets visual information to guide movement. Here we attempt a synthetic overview of the vast literature on interception. We discuss in detail the behavioral and neurophysiological aspects of interception of targets falling under gravity, as this topic has received special attention in recent years. We show that visual cues alone are insufficient to predict the time and place of interception or avoidance, and they need to be supplemented by prior knowledge (or internal models) about several features of the dynamic interaction with the moving object.},

	abstract = {Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that, when the visual information about an object's motion differs on the local (edge-related) and global levels, the local 1D motion cues dominate initially, whereas 2D information takes progressively over and leads to the final correct representation of global motion. Previous models have explained the initial errors (deviations from the global motion) in terms of best perceptual guess in the Bayesian sense. These models accounted for the intrinsic sensory noise of the image and general expectancies for object velocities. Here we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, with the purpose of encompassing the whole dynamical evolution of motion processing, from the 1D cues to the correct global motion. Our model is motivated and constrained by smooth pursuit oculomotor data. Eye movements were recorded in 3 participants using the scleral search coil technique. Participants were asked to track either a single line (vertical or oblique) or a Gaussian blob moving horizontally. In our model, oculomotor data obtained with non ambiguous stimuli (e.g. with coherent local and global information, such as a Gaussian blob or a vertical line moving horizontally) are combined to constrain the initial likelihood and prior functions for the general, ambiguous case (e.g. a tilted line moving horizontally). The prior knowledge is then recursively updated by using the previous posterior probability as the current prior. The idea is that the recursive injection of posterior distribution boosts the spread of information about the object's shape, favoring the integration of 1D and 2D cues. In addition, a simple model of the sensory-oculomotor loop is taken into account, including transmission delays and the evolution of the retinal motion during pursuit. Preliminary results show substantial agreement between the model prediction and the oculomotor data.},

	abstract = {A moving object is perceived to lie beyond a static object presented at the same time at the same retinal location (flash-lag effect or {FLE}). Some studies report that if the moving stimulus stops moving (flash-terminated condition or {FTC}) the instant the flash occurs, a {FLE} does not occur. Other studies, using different stimuli, report that the {FLE} does, in fact, occur in the {FTC}. The {FTC} is thus a crucial turning point in theories of flash-lag. Unraveling the mystery of the {FLE} in the {FTC} will help unravel the mechanisms underpinning flash-lag and perhaps even perceptual localization in general. Our experiments show that eccentricity of the moving stimulus was a contributing factor, as were eccentricity of the flashed stimulus and spatial separation between the two stimuli. Other factors, such as contrast and offset of moving stimulus, also modulate the magnitude of the {FLE} in the {FTC}. We surmise that uncertainty in determining the position in space of a moving stimulus is a key requirement for the lag-effect. A lag-effect in the {FTC} challenges influential models, such as differential latency, motion extrapolation, and postdiction. Based partly on the notion of an asymmetric spread of activity that arises because of the sheer nature of motion and from a combination of established physiological mechanisms, we propose a schematic account of the present findings that subsumes previous psychological models and scaffolds past experimental findings.

This smooth pursuit response aims to reduce image motion on the retina that could blur visual perception. In recent years, our knowledge of the neural control of smooth pursuit initiation has sharply increased. However, stopping smooth pursuit eye movements is less well understood and will be discussed in this paper. The most straightforward way to study smooth pursuit stopping is by interrupting image motion on the retina. This causes eye velocity to decay exponentially towards zero. However, smooth pursuit stopping is not a passive response, as shown by behavioural and electrophysiological evidence. Moreover, smooth pursuit stopping is particularly influenced by active prediction of the upcoming end of the target. Here, we suggest that a particular class of inhibitory neurons of the brainstem, the omnipause neurons, could play a central role in pursuit stopping. Furthermore, the role of supplementary eye fields of the frontal cortex in smooth pursuit stopping is also discussed.This article is part of the themed issue 'Movement suppression: brain mechanisms for stopping and stillness'.},

Spikes at each location generated outward traveling {LFP} waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these {LFP} waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: {LFP} traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a approximately 1.5-mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.},

	abstract = {A necessary consequence of the nature of neural transmission systems is that as change in the physical state of a time-varying event takes place, delays produce error between the instantaneous registered state and the external state. Another source of delay is the transmission of internal motor commands to muscles and the inertia of the musculoskeletal system. How does the central nervous system compensate for these pervasive delays? Although it has been argued that delay compensation occurs late in the motor planning stages, even the earliest visual processes, such as phototransduction, contribute significantly to delays. I argue that compensation is not an exclusive property of the motor system, but rather, is a pervasive feature of the central nervous system ({CNS}) organization. Although the motor planning system may contain a highly flexible compensation mechanism, accounting not just for delays but also variability in delays (e.g., those resulting from variations in luminance contrast, internal body temperature, muscle fatigue, etc.), visual mechanisms also contribute to compensation. Previous suggestions of this notion of "visual prediction" led to a lively debate producing re-examination of previous arguments, new analyses, and review of the experiments presented here. Understanding visual prediction will inform our theories of sensory processes and visual perception, and will impact our notion of visual awareness.},

	abstract = {We present {YOLO}, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base {YOLO} model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast {YOLO}, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the {mAP} of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, {YOLO} makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, {YOLO} learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including {DPM} and R-{CNN}, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

	abstract = {Extensive electrophysiology studies have shown that many V1 simple cells have nonlinear response properties to stimuli within their classical receptive field ({CRF}) and receive contextual influence from stimuli outside the {CRF} modulating the cell's response. Models seeking to explain these non-classical receptive field ({nCRF}) effects in terms of circuit mechanisms, input-output descriptions, or individual visual tasks provide limited insight into the functional significance of these response properties, because they do not connect the full range of {nCRF} effects to optimal sensory coding strategies. The (population) sparse coding hypothesis conjectures an optimal sensory coding approach where a neural population uses as few active units as possible to represent a stimulus. We demonstrate that a wide variety of {nCRF} effects are emergent properties of a single sparse coding model implemented in a neurally plausible network structure (requiring no parameter tuning to produce different effects). Specifically, we replicate a wide variety of {nCRF} electrophysiology experiments (e.g., end-stopping, surround suppression, contrast invariance of orientation tuning, cross-orientation suppression, etc.) on a dynamical system implementing sparse coding, showing that this model produces individual units that reproduce the canonical {nCRF} effects. Furthermore, when the population diversity of an {nCRF} effect has also been reported in the literature, we show that this model produces many of the same population characteristics. These results show that the sparse coding hypothesis, when coupled with a biophysically plausible implementation, can provide a unified high-level functional interpretation to many response properties that have generally been viewed through distinct mechanistic or phenomenological models. Simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) demonstrate many response properties that are either nonlinear or involve response modulations (i.e., stimuli that do not cause a response in isolation alter the cell's response to other stimuli). These non-classical receptive field ({nCRF}) effects are generally modeled individually and their collective role in biological vision is not well understood. Previous work has shown that classical receptive field ({CRF}) properties of V1 cells (i.e., the spatial structure of the visual field responsive to stimuli) could be explained by the sparse coding hypothesis, which is an optimal coding model that conjectures a neural population should use the fewest number of cells simultaneously to represent each stimulus. In this paper, we have performed extensive simulated physiology experiments to show that many {nCRF} response properties are simply emergent effects of a dynamical system implementing this same sparse coding model. These results suggest that rather than representing disparate information processing operations themselves, these {nCRF} effects could be consequences of an optimal sensory coding strategy that attempts to represent each stimulus most efficiently. This interpretation provides a potentially unifying high-level functional interpretation to many response properties that have generally been viewed through distinct models.},

The work of this committee led to key findings and recommendations for reform, detailed in a consensus report entitled Identifying the Culprit: Assessing Eyewitness Identification In this review, I focus on the scientific issues that emerged from this study, along with brief discussions of how these issues led to specific recommendations for additional research, best practices for law enforcement, and use of eyewitness evidence by the courts.},

	abstract = {In primates, the appearance of an object moving in the peripheral visual field elicits an interceptive saccade that brings the target image onto the foveae. This foveation is then maintained more or less efficiently by slow pursuit eye movements and subsequent catch-up saccades. Sometimes, the tracking is such that the gaze direction looks spatiotemporally locked onto the moving object. Such a spatial synchronism is quite spectacular when one considers that the target-related signals are transmitted to the motor neurons through multiple parallel channels connecting separate neural populations with different conduction speeds and delays. Because of the delays between the changes of retinal activity and the changes of extraocular muscle tension, the maintenance of the target image onto the fovea cannot be driven by the current retinal signals as they correspond to past positions of the target. Yet, the spatiotemporal coincidence observed during pursuit suggests that the oculomotor system is driven by a command estimating continuously the current location of the target, i.e., where it is here and now. This inference is also supported by experimental perturbation studies: when the trajectory of an interceptive saccade is experimentally perturbed, a correction saccade is produced in flight or after a short delay, and brings the gaze next to the location where unperturbed saccades would have landed at about the same time, in the absence of visual feedback. In this chapter, we explain how such correction can be supported by previous visual signals without assuming “predictive” signals encoding future target locations. We also describe the basic neural processes which gradually yield the synchronization of eye movements with the target motion. When the process fails, the gaze is driven by signals related to past locations of the target, not by estimates to its upcoming locations, and a catch-up is made to reinitiate the synchronization.},

The transition caused by increased input conductance and synaptic fluctuations in membrane potential was suggested to originate from intense concurrent inhibition and excitation. We show that the conductance increase in motoneurons during functional network activity is mainly caused by intrinsic outward rectification near threshold for action potentials by activation of voltage and Ca(2+) gated K channels. Intrinsic outward rectification facilitates spiking by focusing synaptic depolarization near threshold for action potentials. By direct recording of synaptic currents, we also show that motoneurons are activated by out-of-phase peaks in excitation and inhibition during network activity, whereas continuous low-level concurrent inhibition and excitation may contribute to irregular firing.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} Neurons embedded in active neural networks can enter a high-conductance state. High-conductance states were observed in spinal motoneurons during rhythmic motor behavior. Assuming no change in intrinsic conductance, it was suggested that the high-conductance state in motoneurons originated from balanced inhibition and excitation. In this study, we demonstrate that intrinsic outward rectification significantly contributes to the high-conductance state. Outward rectification balances synaptic excitation and maintains membrane potential near spike threshold. In addition, direct synaptic current recordings show out-of-phase excitation and inhibition in motoneurons during rhythmic network activity.},

Recent evidence further suggests that the motion of one object can alter the perceived positions of stationary objects in remote regions of visual space (Whitney \& Cavanagh, 2000). This indicates that there is an influence of motion on perceived position, and that this influence can extend over large areas of the visual field. Yet, it remains unclearwhether themotion of one object shifts the perceived positions of other moving stimuli. To test this we measured two well-known visual illusions, the Fröhlich effect and representationalmomentum, in the presence of extraneous surroundingmotion. We found that themagnitude of thesemislocalizationswas altered depending on the direction and speed of the surroundingmotion. The results indicate that the positions assigned to stationary and moving objects are affected by motion signals over large areas of space and that both types of stimuli may be assigned positions by a common mechanism.

However, such a surfeit of control raises an additional choice problem: how to arbitrate between the systems when they disagree. Here, we consider dual-action choice systems from a normative perspective, using the computational theory of reinforcement learning. We identify a key trade-off pitting computational simplicity against the flexible and statistically efficient use of experience. The trade-off is realized in a competition between the dorsolateral striatal and prefrontal systems. We suggest a Bayesian principle of arbitration between them according to uncertainty, so each controller is deployed when it should be most accurate. This provides a unifying account of a wealth of experimental evidence about the factors favoring dominance by either system.},

	abstract = {In its full sense, perception rests on an agent's model of how its sensory input comes about and the inferences it draws based on this model. These inferences are necessarily uncertain. Here, we illustrate how the hierarchical Gaussian filter ({HGF}) offers a principled and generic way to deal with the several forms that uncertainty in perception takes. The {HGF} is a recent derivation of one-step update equations from Bayesian principles that rests on a hierarchical generative model of the environment and its (in)stability. It is computationally highly efficient, allows for online estimates of hidden states, and has found numerous applications to experimental data from human subjects. In this paper, we generalize previous descriptions of the {HGF} and its account of perceptual uncertainty. First, we explicitly formulate the extension of the {HGF}'s hierarchy to any number of levels; second, we discuss how various forms of uncertainty are accommodated by the minimization of variational free energy as encoded in the update equations; third, we combine the {HGF} with decision models and demonstrate the inversion of this combination; finally, we report a simulation study that compared four optimization methods for inverting the {HGF}/decision model combination at different noise levels. These four methods (Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, Gaussian process-based global optimization, variational Bayes and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling) all performed well even under considerable noise, with variational Bayes offering the best combination of efficiency and informativeness of inference. Our results demonstrate that the {HGF} provides a principled, flexible, and efficient - but at the same time intuitive - framework for the resolution of perceptual uncertainty in behaving agents.},

	abstract = {Cortical motion analysis continuously encodes image velocity but might also be used to predict future patterns of sensory input along the motion path. We asked whether this predictive aspect of motion is exploited by the human visual system. Targets can be more easily detected at the leading as compared to the trailing edge of motion [1], but this effect has been attributed to a nonspecific boost in contrast gain at the leading edge, linked to motion-induced shifts in spatial position [1-4]. Here we show that the detectability of a local sinusoidal target presented at the ends of a region containing motion is phase dependent at the leading edge, but not at the trailing edge. These two observations rule out a simple gain control mechanism that modulates contrast energy and passive filtering explanations, respectively. By manipulating the relative orientation of the moving pattern and target, we demonstrate that the resulting spatial variation in detection threshold along the edge closely resembles the superposition of sensory input and an internally generated predicted signal. These findings show that motion induces a forward prediction of spatial pattern that combines with the cortical representation of the future stimulus.},

	abstract = {Sensory input enters the cortex via the thalamocortical ({TC}) projection, where it elicits large postsynaptic potentials in layer 4 neurons 1. Interestingly, the {TC} connections account for only \${\textbackslash}sim\$15\% of synapses onto these neurons. It has been therefore controversially discussed how thalamic input can drive the cortex. Strong {TC} synapses have been one suggestion to ensure the strength of the {TC} projection ("strong-synapse model"). Another possibility is that the excitation from single thalamic fibers are weak but get amplified by recurrent excitatory feedback in layer 4 ("amplifier model"). Bruno and Sakmann 2 recently provided new evidence that individual {TC} synapses in vivo are weak and only produce small excitatory postsynaptic potentials. However, they suggested that thalamic input can activate the cortex due to the synchronous firing and that cortical amplification is not required. This would support the "synchrony model" proposed by correlation analysis 3. Here, we studied the effect of correlation in the {TC} input, with weak synapses, to the responses of a layered cortical network model. The connectivity of the layered network was taken from Binzegger et al. 2004 4. The network was simulated using {NEST} 5 with the Python interface {PyNN} 6 to enable interoperability with different simulators. The sensory input to layer 4 was modelled by a simple retino-geniculate model of the transformation of light into spike trains 7, which was implemented by leaky integrate-and-fire model neurons. We found that introducing correlation into {TC} inputs enhanced the likelihood to produce responses in layer 4 and improved the activity propagation across layers. In addition, we compared the response of the cortical network to different noise conditions and obtained contrast response functions which were in accordance with This Work is supported by the 6th {RFP} of the {EU} (grant no. 15879-{FACETS}) and by the {BMBF} grant 01GQ0420 to the {BCCN} Freiburg. 1.

	abstract = {Uncertainty in various forms plagues our interactions with the environment. In a Bayesian statistical framework, optimal inference and prediction, based on unreliable observations in changing contexts, require the representation and manipulation of different forms of uncertainty. We propose that the neuromodulators acetylcholine and norepinephrine play a major role in the brain's implementation of these uncertainty computations. Acetylcholine signals expected uncertainty, coming from known unreliability of predictive cues within a context. Norepinephrine signals unexpected uncertainty, as when unsignaled context switches produce strongly unexpected observations. These uncertainty signals interact to enable optimal inference and learning in noisy and changeable environments. This formulation is consistent with a wealth of physiological, pharmacological, and behavioral data implicating acetylcholine and norepinephrine in specific aspects of a range of cognitive processes. Moreover, the model suggests a class of attentional cueing tasks that involve both neuromodulators and shows how their interactions may be part-antagonistic, part-synergistic.

	abstract = {Five experiments were designed to determine whether a rotating, transparent 3-D cloud of dots (simulated sphere) could influence the perceived direction of rotation of a subsequent sphere. Experiment 1 established conditions under which the direction of rotation of a virtual sphere was perceived unambiguously. When a near-far luminance difference and perspective depth cues were present, observers consistently saw the sphere rotate in the intended direction. In Experiment 2, a near-far luminance difference was used to create an unambiguous rotation sequence that was followed by a directionally ambiguous rotation sequence that lacked both the near-far luminance cue and the perspective cue. Observers consistently saw the second sequence as rotating in the same direction as the first, indicating the presence of 3-D visual inertia. Experiment 3 showed that 3-D visual inertia was sufficiently powerful to bias the perceived direction of a rotation sequence made unambiguous by a near-far luminance cue. Experiment 5 showed that 3-D visual inertia could be obtained using an occlusion depth cue to create an unambiguous inertia-inducing sequence. Finally, Experiments 2, 4, and 5 all revealed a fast-decay phase of inertia that lasted for approximately 800 msec, followed by an asymptotic phase that lasted for periods as long as 1,600 msec. The implications of these findings are examined with respect to motion mechanisms of 3-D visual inertia.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns numerical assessment of Monte Carlo error in particle filters. We show that by keeping track of certain key features of the genealogical structure arising from resampling operations, it is possible to estimate variances of a number of standard Monte Carlo approximations which particle filters deliver. All our estimators can be computed from a single run of a particle filter with no further simulation. We establish that as the number of particles grows, our estimators are weakly consistent for asymptotic variances of the Monte Carlo approximations and some of them are also non-asymptotically unbiased. The asymptotic variances can be decomposed into terms corresponding to each time step of the algorithm, and we show how to consistently estimate each of these terms. When the number of particles may vary over time, this allows approximation of the asymptotically optimal allocation of particle numbers.},

The top and bottom dots were flashed at time t1 and replaced by the left and right dots at time t2. If two priming dots were flashed beforehand at time t0 in line with two parallel sides of the diamond, {AM} was seen along those sides. We call this ” visual inertia”. The amount of visual inertia (measured by a null method) fell off with increasing angle between the priming dot and the side of the diamond. Visual inertia was still seen when the priming dots were presented to one eye and the test dots to the other, so the effect must be partly central. The timing and length of the priming path made little difference to visual inertia. However, static priming dots were ineffective. We conclude that the visual system was examining at least three successive time frames in deciding which items in one frame correspond with which items in succeeding frames.},

Together, they can be regarded as a single brain system that underlies active vision—the normal vision that begins with visual processing in the retina and extends through the brain to the generation of eye movement by the brainstem. The system is probably one of the most thoroughly studied brain systems in the primate, and it offers an ideal opportunity to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the series of perturbation techniques that have been used to study it. The perturbations have been critical in moving from correlations between neuronal activity and behaviour closer to a causal relation between neuronal activity and behaviour. The same perturbation techniques have also been used to tease out neuronal circuits that are related to active vision that in turn are driving behaviour. The evolution of perturbation techniques includes ablation of both cortical and subcortical targets, punctate chemical lesions, reversible inactivations, electrical stimulation, and finally the expanding optogenetic techniques. The evolution of perturbation techniques has supported progressively stronger conclusions about what neuronal circuits in the brain underlie active vision and how the circuits themselves might be organized.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference ({VI}), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. {VI} has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind {VI} is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of {VI} applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in {VI} and highlight important open problems. {VI} is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

Most studies, especially those using {fMRI}, widely assume that the location of the peak retinotopic activity generated in the visual cortex by an object is the position assigned to that object-this is a simplified version of the local sign hypothesis. Here, we employed a novel technique to compare the pattern of responses to moving and stationary objects and found that the local sign hypothesis is false. By spatially correlating populations of voxel responses to different moving and stationary stimuli in different positions, we recovered the modulation transfer function for moving patterns. The results show that the pattern of responses to a moving object is best correlated with the response to a static object that is located behind the moving one. The pattern of responses across the visual cortex was able to distinguish object positions separated by about 0.25 deg visual angle, equivalent to approximately 0.25 mm cortical distance. We also found that the position assigned to a pattern is not simply dictated by the peak activity-the shape of the luminance envelope and the resulting shape of the population response, including the shape and skew in the response at the edges of the pattern, influences where the visual cortex assigns the object's position. Therefore, visually coded position is not conveyed by the peak but by the overall profile of activity.},

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability.

Critics of this view have argued that claims of optimality are overly flexible and lack explanatory power. Meanwhile, advocates for optimality have countered that such criticisms single out a few selected papers. To elucidate the issue of optimality in perceptual decision making, we review the extensive literature on suboptimal performance in perceptual tasks. We discuss eight different classes of suboptimal perceptual decisions, including improper placement, maintenance, and adjustment of perceptual criteria, inadequate tradeoff between speed and accuracy, inappropriate confidence ratings, misweightings in cue combination, and findings related to various perceptual illusions and biases. In addition, we discuss conceptual shortcomings of a focus on optimality, such as definitional difficulties and the limited value of optimality claims in and of themselves. We therefore advocate that the field drop its emphasis on whether observed behavior is optimal and instead concentrate on building and testing detailed observer models that explain behavior across a wide range of tasks. To facilitate this transition, we compile the proposed hypotheses regarding the origins of suboptimal perceptual decisions reviewed here. We argue that verifying, rejecting, and expanding these explanations for suboptimal behavior – rather than assessing optimality per se – should be among the major goals of the science of perceptual decision making.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The perception of yellow has played a central role in distinguishing two main theories of colour vision. Hering proposed that yellow results from the activation of a distinct retinal-neural mechanism, whereas according to the Young-Helmholtz-Maxwell view, yellow results from the combined activation of red and green cone mechanisms. When red and green images are presented separately to corresponding retinal locations in the two eyes, the resulting sensation is yellow. As the pathways from the two eyes do not converge until the cortex, this suggests that yellow can indeed arise from the central combining of separate red and green channels. I now show that the reverse process can also occur; the visual system can decompose a 'yellow' stimulus into its constituent red and green components. A 'yellow' stimulus was created by optically superimposing a flashed red line onto a moving green bar. If the bar is visible only briefly, the flashed line appears yellow. If the trajectory of the green bar is exposed for sufficient time, however, the line is incorrectly perceived to trail the bar, and appears red. Motion processing occurs in the cortex rather than the retina in primates, and so the ability of motion cues to affect the perception of colour is consistent with the Young-Helmholtz-Maxwell notion of a 'central synthesis' of yellow.},

However, our understanding of how these models work, especially what computations they perform at intermediate layers, has lagged behind. Progress in the field will be further accelerated by the development of better tools for visualizing and interpreting neural nets. We introduce two such tools here. The first is a tool that visualizes the activations produced on each layer of a trained convnet as it processes an image or video (e.g. a live webcam stream). We have found that looking at live activations that change in response to user input helps build valuable intuitions about how convnets work. The second tool enables visualizing features at each layer of a {DNN} via regularized optimization in image space. Because previous versions of this idea produced less recognizable images, here we introduce several new regularization methods that combine to produce qualitatively clearer, more interpretable visualizations. Both tools are open source and work on a pre-trained convnet with minimal setup.},

By simulating a noisy and volatile environment, we demonstrate how uncertainty influences optimal epistemic (visual) foraging. In our simulations, saccades were deployed less frequently to regions with a lower sensory precision, while a greater volatility led to a shorter inhibition of return. These simulations illustrate a principled explanation for some cardinal aspects of visual foraging-and allow us to propose a correspondence between the representation of uncertainty and ascending neuromodulatory systems, complementing that suggested by Yu \& Dayan (Yu \& Dayan 2005 Neuron46, 681-692.

Instead, they usually contain motion signals originating either from moving objects or from retinal slip caused by self-motion. Accordingly, motion signals tell the animal in which direction a predator, prey, or the animal itself is moving. At the neural level, visual motion detection has been proposed to extract directional information by a delay-and-compare mechanism, representing a classic example of neural computation. Neurons responding selectively to motion in one but not in the other direction have been identified in many systems, most prominently in the mammalian retina and the fly optic lobe. Technological advances have now allowed researchers to characterize these neurons' upstream circuits in exquisite detail. Focusing on these upstream circuits, we review and compare recent progress in understanding the mechanisms that generate direction selectivity in the early visual system of mammals and flies.

We examine these strategies using recent examples from computer vision, and outline some important imlications for cognitive science. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Improved understanding of the factors that govern folding of the cerebral cortex is desirable for many reasons. The existence of consistent patterns in folding within and between species suggests a fundamental role in brain function. Abnormal folding patterns found in individuals affected by a diverse array of neurodevelopmental disorders underline the clinical relevance of understanding the folding process. Recent experimental and computational efforts to elucidate the biomechanical forces involved in cerebral cortical folding have converged on a consistent approach. Brain growth is modeled with two components: an expanding outer zone, destined to become the cerebral cortex, is mechanically coupled to an inner zone, destined to become white matter, that grows at a slower rate, perhaps in response to stress induced by expansion from the outer layer. This framework is consistent with experimentally observed internal forces in developing brains, and with observations of the folding process in physical models. In addition, computational simulations based on this foundation can produce folding patterns that recapitulate the characteristics of folding patterns found in gyroencephalic brains. This perspective establishes the importance of mechanical forces in our current understanding of how brains fold, and identifies realistic ranges for specific parameters in biophysical models of developing brain tissue. However, further refinement of this approach is needed. An understanding of mechanical forces that arise during brain development and their cellular-level origins is necessary to interpret the consequences of abnormal brain folding and its role in functional deficits as well as neurodevelopmental disease.Dual Perspectives Companion Paper: How Cells Fold the Cerebral Cortex, by Víctor Borrell.},

	abstract = {This paper describes novel event-based spatiotemporal features called time-surfaces and how they can be used to create a hierarchical event-based pattern recognition architecture. Unlike existing hierarchical architectures for pattern recognition, the presented model relies on a time oriented approach to extract spatio-temporal features from the asynchronously acquired dynamics of a visual scene. These dynamics are acquired using biologically inspired frameless asynchronous event-driven vision sensors. Similarly to cortical structures, subsequent layers in our hierarchy extract increasingly abstract features using increasingly large spatio-temporal windows. The central concept is to use the rich temporal information provided by events to create contexts in the form of time-surfaces which represent the recent temporal activity within a local spatial neighborhood. We demonstrate that this concept can robustly be used at all stages of an event-based hierarchical model. First layer feature units operate on groups of pixels, while subsequent layer feature units operate on the output of lower level feature units. We report results on a previously published 36 class character recognition task and a 4 class canonical dynamic card pip task, achieving near 100\% accuracy on each. We introduce a new 7 class moving face recognition task, achieving 79\% accuracy.},

A high-level strategy guides ongoing choices, and the outcomes of those choices determine whether or not the strategy should change. When the right decision strategy is uncertain, as in most natural settings, feedback becomes ambiguous because negative outcomes may be due to limited information or bad strategy. Disambiguating the cause of feedback requires active inference and is key to updating the strategy. We hypothesize that the expected accuracy of a choice plays a crucial rule in this inference, and setting the strategy depends on integration of outcome and expectations across choices. We test this hypothesis with a task in which subjects report the net direction of random dot kinematograms with varying difficulty while the correct stimulus-response association undergoes invisible and unpredictable switches every few trials. We show that subjects treat negative feedback as evidence for a switch but weigh it with their expected accuracy. Subjects accumulate switch evidence (in units of log-likelihood ratio) across trials and update their response strategy when accumulated evidence reaches a bound. A computational framework based on these principles quantitatively explains all aspects of the behavior, providing a plausible neural mechanism for the implementation of hierarchical multiscale decision processes. We suggest that a similar neural computation-bounded accumulation of evidence-underlies both the choice and switches in the strategy that govern the choice, and that expected accuracy of a choice represents a key link between the levels of the decision-making hierarchy.},

The extracted information is then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations.

Even worse, with the slow homeostatic plasticity reported in experiments, simulations of existing plasticity models cannot maintain network stability unless further control mechanisms are implemented. To solve this paradox, we suggest that in addition to slow forms of homeostatic plasticity there are {RCPs} which stabilize synaptic plasticity on short timescales. These rapid processes may include heterosynaptic depression triggered by episodes of high postsynaptic firing rate. While slower forms of homeostatic plasticity are not sufficient to stabilize Hebbian plasticity, they are important for fine-tuning neural circuits. Taken together we suggest that learning and memory rely on an intricate interplay of diverse plasticity mechanisms on different timescales which jointly ensure stability and plasticity of neural circuits.This article is part of the themed issue 'Integrating Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity'.},

	abstract = {Complex cognitive behaviors, such as context-switching and rule-following, are thought to be supported by prefrontal cortex ({PFC}). Neural activity in {PFC} must thus be specialized to specific tasks while retaining flexibility. Nonlinear 'mixed' selectivity is an important neurophysiological trait for enabling complex and context-dependent behaviors. Here we investigate (1) the extent to which {PFC} exhibits computationally-relevant properties such as mixed selectivity and (2) how such properties could arise via circuit mechanisms. We show that {PFC} cells recorded from male and female rhesus macaques during a complex task show a moderate level of specialization and structure that is not replicated by a model wherein cells receive random feedforward inputs. While random connectivity can be effective at generating mixed selectivity, the data shows significantly more mixed selectivity than predicted by a model with otherwise matched parameters. A simple Hebbian learning rule applied to the random connectivity, however, increases mixed selectivity and allows the model to match the data more accurately. To explain how learning achieves this, we provide analysis along with a clear geometric interpretation of the impact of learning on selectivity. After learning, the model also matches the data on measures of noise, response density, clustering, and the distribution of selectivities. Of two styles of Hebbian learning tested, the simpler and more biologically plausible option better matches the data. These modeling results give intuition about how neural properties important for cognition can arise in a circuit and make clear experimental predictions regarding how various measures of selectivity would evolve during animal training.Significance Statement: Prefrontal cortex ({PFC}) is a brain region believed to support the ability of animals to engage in complex behavior. How neurons in this area respond to stimuli—and in particular, to combinations of stimuli ("mixed selectivity")-is a topic of interest. Despite the fact that models with random feedforward connectivity are capable of creating computationally-relevant mixed selectivity, such a model does not match the levels of mixed selectivity seen in the data analyzed in this study. Adding simple Hebbian learning to the model increases mixed selectivity to the correct level and makes the model match the data on several other relevant measures. This study thus offers predictions on how mixed selectivity and other properties evolve with training.},

A crucial component to enhance reproducibility is to comprehensively collect and store metadata, that is all information about the experiment, the data, and the applied preprocessing steps on the data, such that they can be accessed and shared in a consistent and simple manner. However, the complexity of experiments, the highly specialized analysis workflows and a lack of knowledge on how to make use of supporting software tools often overburden researchers to perform such a detailed documentation. For this reason, the collected metadata are often incomplete, incomprehensible for outsiders or ambiguous. Based on our research experience in dealing with diverse datasets, we here provide conceptual and technical guidance to overcome the challenges associated with the collection, organization, and storage of metadata in a neurophysiology laboratory. Through the concrete example of managing the metadata of a complex experiment that yields multi-channel recordings from monkeys performing a behavioral motor task, we practically demonstrate the implementation of these approaches and solutions with the intention that they may be generalized to a specific project at hand. Moreover, we detail five use cases that demonstrate the resulting benefits of constructing a well-organized metadata collection when processing or analyzing the recorded data, in particular when these are shared between laboratories in a modern scientific collaboration. Finally, we suggest an adaptable workflow to accumulate, structure and store metadata from different sources using, by way of example, the {odML} metadata framework.},

However, normalizing along the batch dimension introduces problems — {BN}'s error increases rapidly when the batch size becomes smaller, caused by inaccurate batch statistics estimation. This limits {BN}'s usage for training larger models and transferring features to computer vision tasks including detection, segmentation, and video, which require small batches constrained by memory consumption. In this paper, we present Group Normalization ({GN}) as a simple alternative to {BN}. {GN} divides the channels into groups and computes within each group the mean and variance for normalization. {GN}'s computation is independent of batch sizes, and its accuracy is stable in a wide range of batch sizes. On {ResNet}-50 trained in {ImageNet}, {GN} has 10.6\% lower error than its {BN} counterpart when using a batch size of 2; when using typical batch sizes, {GN} is comparably good with {BN} and outperforms other normalization variants. Moreover, {GN} can be naturally transferred from pre-training to fine-tuning. {GN} can outperform or compete with its {BN}-based counterparts for object detection and segmentation in {COCO}, and for video classification in Kinetics, showing that {GN} can effectively replace the powerful {BN} in a variety of tasks. {GN} can be easily implemented by a few lines of code in modern libraries.},

Although this spatial averaging could arise from executing a weighted average of motor plans for the potential targets, it could also arise from planning a single, optimal movement. To test between these alternatives we used a task in which participants were required to reach to either a single target or towards two potential targets while grasping an object. A robotic device applied a lateral elastic load to the object requiring large grip forces for reaches to targets either side of midline and a minimal grip force for midline movements. As expected, in trials with two targets located either side of midline, participants initially reached straight ahead. Critically, on these trials the initial grip force was minimal, appropriate for the midline movement, and not the average of the large grip forces required for movements to the individual targets. These results indicate that under conditions of target uncertainty, people do not execute an average of planned actions but rather a single movement that optimizes motor costs.},

For demonstration, we trained recurrent spiking networks on two dynamic tasks: one that requires optimizing fast (≈ millisecond) spike-based interactions for efficient encoding of information, and a delayed memory {XOR} task over extended duration (≈ second). The results show that our method indeed optimizes the spiking network dynamics on the time scale of individual spikes as well as behavioral time scales. In conclusion, our result offers a general purpose supervised learning algorithm for spiking neural networks, thus advancing further investigations on spike-based computation.},

	abstract = {This paper is concerned with a striking visual experience: that of seeing geometric visual hallucinations. Hallucinatory images were classi¢ed by Klu« ver into four groups called form constants comprising (i) gratings, lattices, fretworks, ¢ligrees, honeycombs and chequer-boards, (ii) cobwebs, (iii) tunnels, funnels, alleys, cones and vessels, and (iv) spirals. This paper describes a mathematical investigation of their origin based on the assumption that the patterns of connection between retina and striate cortex (henceforth referred to as V1)öthe retinocortical mapöand of neuronal circuits in V1, both local and lateral, determine their geometry. In the ¢rst part of the paper we show that form constants, when viewed in V1 coordinates, essentially correspond to combinations of plane waves, the wavelengths of which are integral multiples of the width of a human Hubel{\textasciicircum}Wiesel hypercolumn, ca. 1.33{\textasciicircum}2 mm. We next introduce a mathematical description of the large-scale dynamics of V1 in terms of the continuum limit of a lattice of interconnected hyper-columns, each of which itself comprises a number of interconnected iso-orientation columns. We then show that the patterns of interconnection in V1 exhibit a very interesting symmetry, i.e. they are invariant under the action of the planar Euclidean group E(2)öthe group of rigid motions in the planeö rotations, re{\textbackslash}poundsections and translations. What is novel is that the lateral connectivity of V1 is such that a new group action is needed to represent its properties: by virtue of its anisotropy it is invariant with respect to certain shifts and twists of the plane. It is this shift {\textasciicircum} twist invariance that generates new representations of E(2). Assuming that the strength of lateral connections is weak compared with that of local connections, we next calculate the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the cortical dynamics, using Rayleigh {\textasciicircum} Schro« dinger perturbation theory. The result is that in the absence of lateral connections, the eigenfunctions are degenerate, comprising both even and odd combinations of sinusoids in , the cortical label for orientation preference, and plane waves in r, the cortical position coordinate Switching-on' the lateral interactions breaks the degeneracy and either even or else odd eigenfunctions are selected. These results can be shown to follow directly from the Euclidean symmetry we have imposed. In the second part of the paper we study the nature of various even and odd combinations of eigen-functions or planforms, the symmetries of which are such that they remain invariant under the particular action of E(2) we have imposed. These symmetries correspond to certain subgroups of E(2), the so-called axial subgroups. Axial subgroups are important in that the equivariant branching lemma indicates that when a symmetrical dynamical system becomes unstable, new solutions emerge which have symmetries corresponding to the axial subgroups of the underlying symmetry group. This is precisely the case studied in this paper. Thus we study the various planforms that emerge when our model V1 dynamics become unstable under the presumed action of hallucinogens or {\textbackslash}poundsickering lights. We show that the planforms correspond to the axial subgroups of E(2), under the shift{\textasciicircum}twist action. We then compute what such planforms would look like in the visual ¢eld, given an extension of the retinocortical map to include its action on local edges and contours. What is most interesting is that, given our interpretation of the correspondence between V1 planforms and perceived patterns, the set of planforms generates represent-atives of all the form constants. It is also noteworthy that the planforms derived from our continuum model naturally divide V1 into what are called linear regions, in which the pattern has a near constant orientation, reminiscent of the iso-orientation patches constructed via optical imaging. The boundaries of such regions form fractures whose points of intersection correspond to the well-knowpinwheels'. To complete the study we then investigate the stability of the planforms, using methods of nonlinear stability analysis, including Liapunov {\textasciicircum} Schmidt reduction and Poincare Lindstedt perturbation theory. We ¢nd a close correspondence between stable planforms and form constants. The results are sensitive to the detailed speci¢cation of the lateral connectivity and suggest an interesting possibility, that the cortical mechanisms by which geometric visual hallucinations are generated, if sited mainly in V1, are closely related to those involved in the processing of edges and contours.

	abstract = {Understanding how local interactions among connected nodes in a network result in global network dynamics and behaviors remains a critical open problem in network theory. This is important both for understanding complex networks, including the brain, and for the controlled design of networks intended to achieve a specific function. Here, we describe the construction and theoretical analysis of a framework derived from canonical neurophysiological principles that models the competing dynamics of incident signals into nodes along directed edges in a network. The framework describes the dynamics between the offset in the latencies of propagating signals, which reflect the geometry of the edges and conduction velocities, and the internal refractory dynamics and processing times of the downstream node. One of the main theoretical results is the definition of a ratio between the speed of signaling or information flow, which is bounded by the spatial geometry, and the internal time it takes for individual nodes to process incoming signals. We show that an optimal ratio is one where the speed of information propagation between connected nodes does not exceed the internal dynamic time scale of the nodes. A mismatch of this ratio leads to sub-optimal signaling and information flows in a network, and even a breakdown in signaling all together.},

This scheme is called Generalised Filtering and furnishes posterior (conditional) densities on hidden states and unknown parameters generating observed data. Crucially, the scheme operates online, assimilating data to optimize the conditional density on time-varying states and time-invariant parameters. In contrast to Kalman and Particle smoothing, Generalised Filtering does not require a backwards pass. In contrast to variational schemes, it does not assume conditional independence between the states and parameters. Generalised Filtering optimises the conditional density with respect to a free-energy bound on the model's log-evidence. This optimisation uses the generalised motion of hidden states and parameters, under the prior assumption that the motion of the parameters is small. We describe the scheme, present comparative evaluations with a fixed-form variational version, and conclude with an illustrative application to a nonlinear state-space model of brain imaging time-series.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we discuss the proposal that such attenuation of self-produced tactile stimulation is due to the sensory predictions made by an internal forward model of the motor system. A forward model predicts the sensory consequences of a movement based on the motor command. When a movement is self-produced, its sensory consequences can be accurately predicted, and this prediction can be used to attenuate the sensory effects of the movement. Studies are reviewed that demonstrate that as the discrepancy between predicted and actual sensory feedback increases during self-produced tactile stimulation there is a concomitant decrease in the level of sensory attenuation and an increase in tickliness. Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that this sensory attenuation might be mediated by somatosensory cortex and anterior cingulate cortex: these areas are activated less by a self-produced tactile stimulus than by the same stimulus when it is externally produced. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the cerebellum might be involved in generating the prediction of the sensory consequences of movement. Finally, recent evidence suggests that this predictive mechanism is abnormal in patients with auditory hallucinations and/or passivity experiences.},

Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success.

Our method simultaneously estimates such atoms, and, for each datapoint, the vector of weights that can optimally reconstruct it as an optimal transport barycenter of such atoms. Our method is computationally tractable thanks to the addition of an entropic regularization to the usual optimal transportation problem, leading to an approximation scheme that is efficient, parallel and simple to differentiate. Both atoms and weights are learned using a gradient-based descent method. Gradients are obtained by automatic differentiation of the generalized Sinkhorn iterations that yield barycenters with entropic smoothing. Because of its formulation relying on Wasserstein barycenters instead of the usual matrix product between dictionary and codes, our method allows for non-linear relationships between atoms and the reconstruction of input data. We illustrate its application in several different image processing settings.},

In visual psychophysics, there is a long tradition of using external noise methods (i.e., adding noise to visual stimuli) as tools for system identification. Here, we demonstrate that external noise affects processing of visual scenes at different cortical areas along the human ventral visual pathway, from retinotopic regions to higher occipitotemporal areas implicated in visual shape processing. We found that when the contrast of the stimulus was held constant, the further away from the retinal input a cortical area was the more its activity, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), depended on the signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) of the visual stimulus. A similar pattern of results was observed when trials with correct and incorrect responses were analyzed separately. We interpret these findings by extending signal detection theory to {fMRI} data analysis. This approach reveals the sequential ordering of decision stages in the cortex by exploiting the relation between {fMRI} response and stimulus {SNR}. In particular, our findings provide novel evidence that occipitotemporal areas in the ventral visual pathway form a cascade of decision stages with increasing degree of signal uncertainty and feature invariance.},

This representation preserves the spatial information inside the human action. Based on this representation, the unknown tensor parameter is decomposed according to the Tucker tensor decomposition at first, and then the optimization problems can be solved using the alternative optimization method, where at each iteration, the tensor descriptor is projected along one order and the parameter along the corresponding order can be estimated by solving the Ridge Regression problem. The estimated tensor parameter is more discriminative because of effectively using the spacial information along each order.

	abstract = {The ventral visual pathway achieves object and face recognition by building transformation-invariant representations from elementary visual features. In previous computer simulation studies with rate-coded neural networks, the development of transformation-invariant representations has been demonstrated using either of two biologically plausible learning mechanisms, Trace learning and Continuous Transformation ({CT}) learning. However, it has not previously been investigated how transformation-invariant representations may be learned in a more biologically accurate spiking neural network. A key issue is how the synaptic connection strengths in such a spiking network might self-organize through Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity ({STDP}) where the change in synaptic strength is dependent on the relative times of the spikes emitted by the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons rather than simply correlated activity driving changes in synaptic efficacy. Here we present simulations with conductance-based integrate-and-fire ({IF}) neurons using a {STDP} learning rule to address these gaps in our understanding. It is demonstrated that with the appropriate selection of model parameters and training regime, the spiking network model can utilize either Trace-like or {CT}-like learning mechanisms to achieve transform-invariant representations.},

Both visually derived and stored velocity information provide input to the tracking system when the target is visible, but after occlusion the system receives its input solely from stored velocity representations. We used {EEG} to investigate the transition to purely memory guided tracking after the initial period of occlusion. Participants fixated while they covertly tracked targets moving horizontally rightward at velocities of 12 or 20 degrees. The targets were either continuously visible or disappeared for a short interval mid trajectory. Similar positive event related components were recorded over the right occipitoparietal region in both tasks, providing further evidence that the same neural systems are involved in tracking both visible and occluded targets. Furthermore, when the target was visible, the development of this positivity was linked to the spatial location of the target, peaking earlier in the 20 degrees condition. However, in the occluded condition the positive deflection began around 200 ms following the onset of occlusion and was not modulated by target velocity or location. This indicates a neural response after occlusion is cortically registered, consistent with the hypothesis that there is increased reliance on memory guided tracking at this point.},

	abstract = {Neuroscience has focused on the detailed implementation of computation, studying neural codes, dynamics and circuits. In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured architectures are used, including dedicated systems for attention, recursion and various forms of short- and long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and training procedures have become more complex and are varied across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are diverse and differ across brain locations and over development, and (3) optimization operates within a pre-structured architecture matched to the computational problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions, serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely targeted to the needs of the organism. We suggest directions by which neuroscience could seek to refine and test these hypotheses.},

However, the relation of these models to the properties of single neurons is unclear. Here we derive an equation for several interacting populations at the mesoscopic scale starting from a microscopic model of randomly connected generalized integrate-and-fire neuron models. Each population consists of 50-2000 neurons of the same type but different populations account for different neuron types. The stochastic population equations that we find reveal how spike-history effects in single-neuron dynamics such as refractoriness and adaptation interact with finite-size fluctuations on the population level. Efficient integration of the stochastic mesoscopic equations reproduces the statistical behavior of the population activities obtained from microscopic simulations of a full spiking neural network model. The theory describes nonlinear emergent dynamics such as finite-size-induced stochastic transitions in multistable networks and synchronization in balanced networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The mesoscopic equations are employed to rapidly integrate a model of a cortical microcircuit consisting of eight neuron types, which allows us to predict spontaneous population activities as well as evoked responses to thalamic input. Our theory establishes a general framework for modeling finite-size neural population dynamics based on single cell and synapse parameters and offers an efficient approach to analyzing cortical circuits and computations.},

	abstract = {The modulatory role of spontaneous brain oscillations on perception of threshold-level stimuli is well established. Here, we provide evidence that alpha-band (∼10 Hz) oscillations not only modulate perception of threshold-level sensory inputs but also can drive perception and generate percepts without a physical stimulus being present. We used the "triple-flash" illusion: Occasional perception of three flashes when only two spatially coincident veridical ones, separated by ∼100 ms, are presented. The illusion was proposed to result from superposition of two hypothetical oscillatory impulse response functions generated in response to each flash: When the delay between flashes matches the period of the oscillation, the superposition enhances a later part of the oscillation that is normally damped; when this enhancement crosses perceptual threshold, a third flash is erroneously perceived (Bowen, 1989). In Experiment 1, we varied stimulus onset asynchrony and validated Bowen's theory: The optimal stimulus onset asynchrony for illusion to occur was correlated, across human subjects (both genders), with the subject-specific impulse response function period determined from a separate {EEG} experiment. Experiment 2 revealed that prestimulus parietal, but no occipital, alpha {EEG} phase and power, as well as poststimulus alpha phase-locking, together determine the occurrence of the illusion on a trial-by-trial basis. Thus, oscillatory reverberations create something out of nothing: A third flash where there are only two.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT} We highlight a novel property of alpha-band (∼10 Hz) oscillations based on three experiments (two {EEG} and one psychophysics) by demonstrating that alpha-band oscillations do not merely modulate perception, but can also drive perception. We show that human participants report seeing a third flash when only two are presented (the "triple-flash" illusion) most often when the interflash delay matches the period of participant's oscillatory impulse response function reverberating in alpha. Within-subject, the phase and power of ongoing parietal, but not occipital, alpha-band oscillations at the time of the first flash determine illusory percept on a trial-by-trial basis. We revealed a physiologically plausible mechanism that validates and extends the original theoretical account of the triple-flash illusion proposed by Bowen in 1989.},

	abstract = {I present a new approach for the interpretation of reaction time ({RT}) data from behavioral experiments. From a physical perspective, the entropy of the {RT} distribution provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing performed by the cognitive system. In this way, the focus is shifted from the conventional interpretation of individual {RTs} being either long or short, into their distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. The new approach enables the estimation of the cognitive processing load without reference to the informational content of the stimuli themselves, thus providing a more appropriate estimate of the cognitive impact of different sources of information that are carried by experimental stimuli or tasks. The paper introduces the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical validation using a database of human {RTs} in lexical tasks (visual lexical decision and word naming). The results show that this new interpretation of {RTs} is more powerful than the traditional one. The method provides theoretical estimates of the processing loads elicited by individual stimuli. These loads sharply distinguish the responses from different tasks. In addition, it provides upper-bound estimates for the speed at which the system processes information. Finally, I argue that the theoretical proposal, and the associated empirical evidence, provide strong arguments for an adaptive system that systematically adjusts its operational processing speed to the particular demands of each stimulus. This finding is in contradiction with Hick's law, which posits a relatively constant processing speed within an experimental context.},

To better understand how such microbial parasites control animal behavior, we examine the cell-level interactions between the species-specific fungal parasite Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato and its carpenter ant host (Camponotus castaneus) at a crucial moment in the parasite's lifecycle: when the manipulated host fixes itself permanently to a substrate by its mandibles. The fungus is known to secrete tissue-specific metabolites and cause changes in host gene expression as well as atrophy in the mandible muscles of its ant host, but it is unknown how the fungus coordinates these effects to manipulate its host's behavior. In this study, we combine techniques in serial block-face scanning-electron microscopy and deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithms to visualize the distribution, abundance, and interactions of this fungus inside the body of its manipulated host. Fungal cells were found throughout the host body but not in the brain, implying that behavioral control of the animal body by this microbe occurs peripherally. Additionally, fungal cells invaded host muscle fibers and joined together to form networks that encircled the muscles. These networks may represent a collective foraging behavior of this parasite, which may in turn facilitate host manipulation.},

	abstract = {The ability to recall discrete memories is thought to depend on the formation of attractor states in recurrent neural networks. In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was encoded, at the same time as interference from competing representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to the recurrent {CA}3 system of the hippocampus as a possible attractor network. Consistent with predictions from these studies, experiments have shown that place representations in {CA}3 and downstream {CA}1 tolerate small changes in the configuration of the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when dissimilarities become larger. However, the kinetics supporting such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous transformation of the spatial context does not change the hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by temporary bistability in the discharge activity of {CA}3 ensembles. Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity states, the {CA}3 network undergoes a short period of competitive flickering between preformed representations of the past and present environment before settling on the latter. Network flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and enhance discriminative power in the presence of weak and ambiguous input cues.},

	abstract = {In many experiments it has been found that stimuli outside the classical receptive-field of orientation-selective cells in the visual cortex can strongly modulate the response properties of these cells. Typically, stimuli with orientation contrasts lead to enhancement, whereas iso-orientation stimuli lead to suppression of the neuronal activity, but these phenomena in general depend in a complicate manner on various parameters like stimulus configuration, contrast, and geometry. In this contribution, we develop a simple theory for such non-classical receptive-field phenomena. We explain the basic mechanisms by a fixed-point analysis. Within this analysis, center-surround experiments can be described by trajectories in parameter space. This allows for a systematic variation of the coupling and stimulation constants. We show that the strength or sign of the enhancement or suppression should not only vary with the experimental paradigm but also with the position of the cell within the cortex. Our results suggest that non-classical receptive-field phenomena are mediated through orientation-specific lateral excitatory interactions.},

In this review, we present a framework for active sensing that forms a closed loop between an ideal observer, that extracts task-relevant information from a sequence of observations, and an ideal planner which specifies the actions that lead to the most informative observations. We discuss active sensing as an approximation to exploration in the wider framework of reinforcement learning, and conversely, discuss several sensory, perceptual, and motor processes as approximations to active sensing. Based on this framework, we introduce a taxonomy of sensing strategies, identify hallmarks of active sensing, and discuss recent advances in formalizing and quantifying active sensing.},

	abstract = {The observation of figure-ground selectivity in neurons of the visual cortex shows that these neurons can be influenced by the image context far beyond the classical receptive field. To clarify the nature of the context integration mechanism, we studied the latencies of neural edge signals, comparing the emergence of context-dependent definition of border ownership with the onset of local edge definition (contrast polarity; stereoscopic depth order). Single-neuron activity was recorded in areas V1 and V2 of Macaca mulatta under behaviorally induced fixation. Whereas local edge definition emerged immediately ({\textless}13 ms) after the edge onset response, the context-dependent signal was delayed by about 30 ms. To see if the context influence was mediated by horizontal fibers within cortex, we measured the latencies of border ownership signals for two conditions in which the relevant context information was located at different distances from the receptive field and compared the latency difference with the difference predicted from horizontal signal propagation. The prediction was based on the increase in cortical distance, computed from the mapping of the test stimuli in the cortex, and the known conduction velocities of horizontal fibers. The measured latencies increased with cortical distance, but much less than predicted by the horizontal propagation hypothesis. Probability calculations showed that an explanation of the context influence by horizontal signal propagation alone is highly unlikely, whereas mechanisms involving back projections from other extrastriate areas are plausible.},

One-third of the 1,615 pathways projecting to the 29 target areas were reported only recently and deemed new-found projections ({NFPs}). {NFPs} are predominantly long-range, low-weight connections. A minimum dominating set analysis (a graph theoretic measure) shows that {NFPs} play a major role in globalizing input to small groups of areas. Randomization tests show that ( i ) {NFPs} make important contributions to the specificity of the connectivity profile of individual cortical areas, and ( ii ) {NFPs} share key properties with known connections at the same distance. We developed a similarity index, which shows that intraregion similarity is high, whereas the interregion similarity declines with distance. For area pairs, there is a steep decline with distance in the similarity and probability of being connected. Nevertheless, the present findings reveal an unexpected binary specificity despite the high density (66\%) of the cortical graph. This specificity is made possible because connections are largely concentrated over short distances. These findings emphasize the importance of long-distance connections in the connectivity profile of an area. We demonstrate that long-distance connections are particularly prevalent for prefrontal areas, where they may play a prominent role in large-scale communication and information integration.},

Here, we have used functional magnetic resonance imaging and the retinotopic mapping technique, which has very recently disclosed the organization of the visual field maps within the monkey {MT}/V5 cluster. We observed a retinotopic organization in humans very similar to that documented in monkeys: an {MT}/V5 cluster that includes areas {MT}/V5, {pMSTv} (putative ventral part of the medial superior temporal area), {pFST} (putative fundus of the superior temporal area), and {pV}4t (putative V4 transitional zone), and neighbors a more ventral putative human posterior inferior temporal area ({phPIT}) cluster. The four areas in the {MT}/V5 cluster and the two areas in the {phPIT} cluster each represent the complete contralateral hemifield. The complete {MT}/V5 cluster comprises 70\% of the motion localizer activation. Human {MT}/V5 is located in the region bound by lateral, anterior, and inferior occipital sulci and occupies only one-fifth of the motion complex. It shares the basic functional properties of its monkey homolog: receptive field size relative to other areas, response to moving and static stimuli, as well as sensitivity to three-dimensional structure from motion. Functional properties sharply distinguish the {MT}/V5 cluster from its immediate neighbors in the {phPIT} cluster and the {LO} (lateral occipital) regions. Together with similarities in retinotopic organization and topological neighborhood, the functional properties suggest that {MT}/V5 in human and macaque cortex are homologous.},

	abstract = {A critical step in the interpretation of the visual world is the integration of the various local motion signals generated by moving objects. This process is complicated by the fact that local velocity measurements can differ depending on contour orientation and spatial position. Specifically, any local motion detector can measure only the component of motion perpendicular to a contour that extends beyond its field of view. This "aperture problem" is particularly relevant to direction-selective neurons early in the visual pathways, where small receptive fields permit only a limited view of a moving object. Here we show that neurons in the middle temporal visual area (known as {MT} or V5) of the macaque brain reveal a dynamic solution to the aperture problem. {MT} neurons initially respond primarily to the component of motion perpendicular to a contour's orientation, but over a period of approximately 60 ms the responses gradually shift to encode the true stimulus direction, regardless of orientation. We also report a behavioural correlate of these neural responses: the initial velocity of pursuit eye movements deviates in a direction perpendicular to local contour orientation, suggesting that the earliest neural responses influence the oculomotor response.},

We propose and test a new theory of the detection and measurement of visual motion, which can account for these signal-in-Brownian-noise experiments. The theory postulates that the signals from local-motion detectors are made coherent in space and time by a special purpose network, and that this coherence boosts signals of features moving along non-random trajectories over time. Two experiments were performed to estimate parameters and test the theory. These experiments showed that detection is impaired with increasing eccentricity, an effect that varies inversely with step size. They also showed that detection improves over durations extending to at least 600 msec. An implementation of the theory accounts for these psychophysical detection measurements.},

	abstract = {We previously examined the cortical processing in response to somatosensory, auditory and noxious stimuli, using magnetoencephalography in humans. Here, we performed a similar analysis of the processing in the human visual cortex for comparative purposes. After flash stimuli applied to the right eye, activations were found in eight cortical areas: the left medial occipital area around the calcarine fissure (primary visual cortex, V1), the left dorsomedial area around the parietooccipital sulcus ({DM}), the ventral ({MOv}) and dorsal ({MOd}) parts of the middle occipital area of bilateral hemispheres, the left temporo-occipito-parietal cortex corresponding to human {MT}/V5 ({hMT}), and the ventral surface of the medial occipital area ({VO}) of the bilateral hemispheres. The mean onset latencies of each cortical activity were (in ms): 27.5 (V1), 31.8 ({DM}), 32.8 (left {MOv}), 32.2 (right {MOv}), 33.4 (left {MOd}), 32.3 (right {MOv}), 37.8 ({hMT}), 46.9 (left {VO}), and 46.4 (right {VO}). Therefore the cortico-cortical connection time of visual processing at the early stage was 4-6 ms, which is very similar to the time delay between sequential activations in somatosensory and auditory processing. In addition, the activities in V1, {MOd}, {DM}, and {hMT} showed a similar biphasic waveform with a reversal of polarity after 10 ms, which is a common activation profile of the cortical activity for somatosensory, auditory, and pain-evoked responses. These results suggest similar mechanisms of the serial cortico-cortical processing of sensory information among all sensory areas of the cortex.},

Over a range of frequencies, position stimuli tended to give larger responses, and response velocity increased linearly with target offset. When open-loop sinusoidal target motion was synthesized using appropriate position-only and velocity-only 'components', the response was about the same as for real sinusoidal motion, suggesting a dominant role for target position in both cases. Using non-periodic step-ramp stimuli as devised by Rashbass, but in the open-loop, the authors have commonly observed position-directed pursuit movements.},

If the oblique line segment is replaced with a spot moving on an oblique trajectory, little if any misalignment is perceived. This accurate alignment of oblique segments depends upon the consistent motion of the dot along the oblique trajectory and not other temporal or spatial characteristics of the motion-defined segments since random plotting of the dot along each oblique segment resulted in robust misalignment. The nullification of the Poggendorff illusion was also obtained if only one of the segments was defined by a moving spot so long as the spot moved in a direction that 'pointed' to the static segment. Moreover, if the occluder boundary was defined by rows of vertically moving dots, was filled with vertically moving dots or was a real (cardboard) occluder, the motion-defined oblique segments were still perceived to be aligned with little error, consistent with the unimpaired detection of a trajectory dot in noise interrupted by similar occluders [Watamaniuk, S.

The biggest challenge comes from the fact that the number of possible network activity patterns scales exponentially with the num- ber of neurons recorded (∼2Neurons). Here we introduce a new statistical method for characterizing neural population activity that requires semi- independent fitting of only as many parameters as the square of the number of neurons, requiring drastically smaller data sets and minimal computation time. The model works by matching the population rate (the number of neurons synchronously active) and the probability that each individual neuron fires given the population rate. We found that this model can accurately fit synthetic data from up to 1000 neurons. We also found that the model could rapidly decode visual stimuli from neural population data from macaque primary visual cortex about 65 ms after stimulus onset. Finally, we used the model to estimate the entropy of neural population activity in developing mouse somatosensory cortex and, surprisingly, found that it first increases, and then decreases during development. This statistical model opens new options for interrogating neural population data and can bolster the use of modern large-scale in vivo Ca2+ and voltage imaging tools.},

The signal is not affected by the intensity of the object, nor of the background. Position persistence decreases with increasing speed, but does not depend on retinal eccentricity. Finally, the persisting signal is not tightly bound to the object that causes it.

However, these relationships can be influenced by many complex, strategic factors that contribute to task performance. Here we discuss several of these factors that share two key features. First, they involve subjects making flexible use of time to process information. Second, this flexibility can reflect the rational regulation of information-processing trade-offs that can play prominent roles in particular temporal epochs: sensitivity to stability versus change for past information, speed versus accuracy for current information, and exploitation versus exploration for future goals. Understanding how subjects manage these trade-offs can be used to help design and interpret psychophysical studies.},

This information can be used to enhance the visual system's ability to detect changes in these parameters. We show that the visibility of the trajectory of a moving object influences the perception of its position. This form of temporal recruitment builds up on a long timescale of approximately 500 ms. Temporary occlusion of the trajectory during this time period reduces recruitment, but does not abolish it. Moreover, we found no spatial restrictions on recruitment on the scale of 10 degrees of arc. When the position of objects on trajectories with different degrees of visibility are compared, this recruitment effect causes spatial offsets. This leads to a visual illusion in which the position of moving objects is misperceived.},

	abstract = {How does the visual system assign the perceived position of a moving object? This question is surprisingly complex, since sluggish responses of photoreceptors and transmission delays along the visual pathway mean that visual cortex does not have immediate information about a moving object's position. In the flash-lag effect ({FLE}), a moving object is perceived ahead of an aligned flash. Psychophysical work on this illusion has inspired models for visual localization of moving objects. However, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms. Here, we investigated the role of neural activity in areas {MT}+ and V1/V2 in localizing moving objects. Using short trains of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ({TMS}) or single pulses at different time points, we measured the influence of {TMS} on the perceived location of a moving object. We found that {TMS} delivered to {MT}+ significantly reduced the {FLE}; single pulse timings revealed a broad temporal tuning with maximum effect for {TMS} pulses, 200 ms after the flash. Stimulation of V1/V2 did not significantly influence perceived position. Our results demonstrate that area {MT}+ contributes to the perceptual localization of moving objects and is involved in the integration of position information over a long time window.},

	abstract = {A hypothesis about sensorimotor integration (the λ model) is described and applied to movement control and kinesthesia. The central idea is that the nervous system organizes positional frames of reference for the sensorimotor apparatus and produces active movements by shifting the frames in terms of spatial coordinates. Kinematic and electromyographic patterns are not programmed, but emerge from the dynamic interaction among the system's components, including external forces within the designated frame of reference. Motoneuronal threshold properties and proprioceptive inputs to motoneurons may be cardinal components of the physiological mechanism that produces positional frames of reference. The hypothesis that intentional movements are produced by shifting the frame of reference is extended to multi-muscle and multi-degrees-of-freedom systems with a solution of the redundancy problem that allows the control of a joint alone or in combination with other joints to produce any desired limb configuration and movement trajectory. The model also implies that for each motor behavior, the nervous system uses a strategy that minimizes the number of changeable control variables and keeps the parameters of these changes invariant. Examples are provided of simulated kinematic and electromyographic signals from single- and multi-joint arm movements produced by suggested patterns of control variables. Empirical support is provided and additional tests of the model are suggested. The model is contrasted with others based on the ideas of programming of motoneuronal activity, muscle forces, stiffness, or movement kinematics},

Using these findings, we design a new algorithm that overcomes some of these limitations and has better convergence properties.

Observations always evidence a positive feedback, warming leading to release of carbon to the atmosphere; however, the processes at play differ depending on the timescales. State-of-the-art Earth System Models now represent these climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, always simulating a positive feedback over the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, although with substantial uncertainty. Recent studies now help to reduce this uncertainty. First, on short timescales, El Niño years record larger than average atmospheric {CO}2 growth rate, with tropical land ecosystems being the main drivers. These climate-carbon cycle anomalies can be used as emerging constraint on the tropical land carbon response to future climate change. Second, centennial variability found in last millennium records can be used to constrain the overall global carbon cycle response to climatic excursions. These independent methods point to climate-carbon cycle feedback at the low-end of the Earth System Models range, indicating that these models overestimate the carbon cycle sensitivity to climate change. These new findings also help to attribute the historical land and ocean carbon sinks to increase in atmospheric {CO}2 and climate change.},

In both pathways, shape sensitivity increased from early visual cortex to extrastriate cortex but then decreased in anterior regions. Moreover, the lateral aspect of the ventral pathway and posterior regions of the dorsal pathway were sensitive to the availability of fundamental shape properties, even for unrecognizable images. This apparent representational similarity between the posterior-dorsal and lateral-ventral regions was corroborated by a multivariate analysis. Finally, as with ventral pathway, the activation profile of posterior dorsal regions was correlated with recognition performance, suggesting a possible contribution to perception. These findings challenge a strict functional dichotomy between the pathways and suggest a more distributed model of shape processing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Given a model and a sequence of observations, the associated marginal likelihood L is central to likelihood-based inference for unknown statistical parameters. We define a class of "twisted" models: each member is specified by a sequence of positive functions psi and has an associated psi-auxiliary particle filter that provides unbiased estimates of L. We identify a sequence psi* that is optimal in the sense that the psi*-auxiliary particle filter's estimate of L has zero variance. In practical applications, psi* is unknown so the psi*-auxiliary particle filter cannot straightforwardly be implemented. We use an iterative scheme to approximate psi*, and demonstrate empirically that the resulting iterated auxiliary particle filter significantly outperforms the bootstrap particle filter in challenging settings. Applications include parameter estimation using a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.},

Recent studies suggest that the brain organizes movements based on minimizing reaching errors in the presence of motor and sensory noise. We present an alternative hypothesis in which movement trajectories also result from acquired knowledge about the geometrical properties of the object that the brain is controlling. To test this hypothesis, we asked human subjects to control a simulated kinematic linkage by continuous finger motion, a completely novel experience. This paradigm removed all biases arising from influences of limb dynamics and past experience. Subjects were exposed to two different types of visual feedback; some saw the entire simulated linkage and others saw only the moving extremity. Consistent with our hypothesis, subjects learned to move the simulated linkage along geodesic lines corresponding to the geometrical structure of the observed motion. Thus, optimizing final accuracy is not the unique determinant of trajectory formation.},

In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent {MM}- {GBSA} calculations. Using the best {RMSD} among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate ({RMSD} ≤ 2.0 {\textbackslash}{AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide {SP} settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta {FlexPepDock} method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully.

However, every time that vision is used to guide an action, retinal motion signals are produced by the movement of the eye and head as the person looks at the object or by the motion of other objects in the scene. To reach for the object accurately, the visuomotor system must separate information about the position of the stationary target from background retinal motion signals-a long-standing problem that is poorly understood. Here we show that the visuomotor system does not distinguish between these two information sources: when observers made fast reaching movements to a briefly presented stationary target, their hand shifted in a direction consistent with the motion of a distant and unrelated stimulus, a result contrary to most other findings. This can be seen early in the hand's trajectory (approximately 120 ms) and occurs continuously from programming of the movement through to its execution. The visuomotor system might make use of the motion signals arising from eye and head movements to update the positions of targets rapidly and redirect the hand to compensate for body movements.},

It converts arbitrary binary input patterns into sparse distributed representations ({SDRs}) using a combination of competitive Hebbian learning rules and homeostatic excitability control. We describe a number of key properties of the spatial pooler, including fast adaptation to changing input statistics, improved noise robustness through learning, efficient use of cells and robustness to cell death. In order to quantify these properties we develop a set of metrics that can be directly computed from the spatial pooler outputs. We show how the properties are met using these metrics and targeted artificial simulations. We then demonstrate the value of the spatial pooler in a complete end-to-end real-world {HTM} system. We discuss the relationship with neuroscience and previous studies of sparse coding.

	abstract = {Response latency – the time taken to initiate or complete an action or task – is one of the principal measures used to investigate the mechanisms subserving human and animal cognitive processes. The right tails of response latency distributions have received little attention in experimental psychology. This is because such very long latencies have traditionally been considered irrelevant for psychological processes, instead, they are expected to reflect `contingent' neural events unrelated to the experimental question. Most current theories predict the right tail of response latency distributions to decrease exponentially. In consequence, current standard practice recommends discarding very long response latencies as `outliers'. Here, I show that the right tails of response latency distributions always follow a power-law with a slope of exactly two. This entails that the very late responses cannot be considered outliers. Rather they provide crucial information that falsifies most current theories of cognitive processing with respect to their exponential tail predictions. This exponent constitutes a fundamental constant of the cognitive system that groups behavioral measures with a variety of physical phenomena.},

We associate bounded rationality with approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. Several constructs such as expected utility, exploration or novelty bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of free energy minimization. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding. In this paper, we consider variational Bayes as a scheme that the brain might use for approximate Bayesian inference. This scheme provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action, which appear to be remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Active inference contextualizes optimal decision theory within embodied inference, where goals become prior beliefs. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (associated with softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution. Crucially, this sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behaviour. The changes in precision during variational updates are remarkably reminiscent of empirical dopaminergic responses—and they may provide a new perspective on the role of dopamine in assimilating reward prediction errors to optimize decision-making.},

	abstract = {The repeated presentation of an identical visual stimulus in the receptive field of a neuron may evoke different spiking patterns at each trial. Probabilistic methods are essential to understand the functional role of this variance within the neural activity. In that case, a Poisson process is the most common model of trial-to-trial variability. For a Poisson process, the variance of the spike count is constrained to be equal to the mean, irrespective of the duration of measurements. Numerous studies have shown that this relationship does not generally hold. Specifically, a majority of electrophysiological recordings show an "overdispersion" effect: responses that exhibit more intertrial variability than expected from a Poisson process alone. A model that is particularly well suited to quantify overdispersion is the Negative-Binomial distribution model. This model is well-studied and widely used but has only recently been applied to neuroscience. In this article, we address three main issues. First, we describe how the Negative-Binomial distribution provides a model apt to account for overdispersed spike counts. Second, we quantify the significance of this model for any neurophysiological data by proposing a statistical test, which quantifies the odds that overdispersion could be due to the limited number of repetitions (trials). We apply this test to three neurophysiological data sets along the visual pathway. Finally, we compare the performance of this model to the Poisson model on a population decoding task. We show that the decoding accuracy is improved when accounting for overdispersion, especially under the hypothesis of tuned overdispersion.},

This flash-lag phenomenon reflects a processing advantage for moving stimuli (Metzger, W. (1932) Psychologische Forschung 16, 176-200; {MacKay}, D. M. (1958) Nature 181, 507-508; Nijhawan, R.

The present study measures the sensitivity of the illusion to unpredictable changes in the direction of motion. A moving stimulus translated upwards and then made a 90 degrees turn leftward or rightward. The flash-lag illusion was measured and it was found that, although the change in direction was unpredictable, the flash was still perceived to lag behind the moving stimulus at all points along the trajectory, a finding that is at odds with the extrapolation hypothesis (Nijhawan, R. (1994) Nature 370, 256-257). The results suggest that there is a shorter latency of the neural response to motion even during unpredictable changes in direction. The latency facilitation therefore appears to be omnidirectional rather than specific to a predictable path of motion (Grzywacz, N. M. \& Amthor, F. R.

First published February 15, 2017; doi:10.1152/jn.00786.2016.—Neurons in the smooth eye movement subregion of the frontal eye field ({FEFsem}) are known to play an important role in voluntary smooth pursuit eye movements. Underlying this function are projections to parietal and prefrontal visual association areas and subcortical structures, all known to play vital but differing roles in the execution of smooth pursuit. Additionally, the {FEFsem} has been shown to carry a diverse array of signals (e.g., eye velocity, acceleration, gain control). We hypothesized that distinct subpopulations of {FEFsem} neurons sub-serve these diverse functions and projections, and that the relative weights of retinal and extraretinal signals could form the basis for categorization of units. To investigate this, we used a step-ramp tracking task with a target blink to determine the relative contributions of retinal and extraretinal signals in individual {FEFsem} neurons throughout pursuit. We found that the contributions of retinal and extraretinal signals to neuronal activity and behavior change through-out the time course of pursuit. A clustering algorithm revealed three distinct neuronal subpopulations: cluster 1 was defined by a higher sensitivity to eye velocity, acceleration, and retinal image motion; cluster 2 had greater activity during blinks; and cluster 3 had signif-icantly greater eye position sensitivity. We also performed a compar-ison with a sample of medial superior temporal neurons to assess similarities and differences between the two areas. Our results indicate the utility of simple tests such as the target blink for parsing the complex and multifaceted roles of cortical areas in behavior. {NEW} \& {NOTEWORTHY} The frontal eye field ({FEF}) is known to play a critical role in volitional smooth pursuit, carrying a variety of signals that are distributed throughout the brain.

It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns.

Technically, we use Forney (normal) factor graphs to elucidate the requisite message passing in terms of its form and scheduling.

	abstract = {{AbstractThe} flash-lag effect refers to the phenomenon in which a flash adjacent to a continuously moving object is perceived to lag behind it. Phenomenally, the flash appears to be spatially shifted relative to the moving stimulus, and the amount of lag has often been quantified as the flash's nulling position, which is the physical spatial offset needed to establish perceptual alignment. The present study offers a better way to summarize flash-lag data. Instead of plotting data in terms of space, the psychometric function of the observer's relative-position judgment is drawn on spatiotemporal plot. The psychological process underlying illusory lag is formulated as spatiotemporal bias and uncertainty and their estimate as a spatiotemporal convolution kernel that best explains the spatiotemporal psychometric function. Two empirical procedures of kernel estimation are described. One procedure is to fit the free parameters of the kernel to experimental data for continuous motion trajectory. The second is to give an analytical solution to the kernel using experimental data for random motion trajectory. The two procedures yield similar kernels, with negligible spatial bias and uncertainty and substantial temporal bias and uncertainty. In addition, it is demonstrated that an experimental manipulation of temporal predictability of the flash can change the temporal bias in the estimated kernel. The results of this novel analysis reveal that the flash-lag effect is viewed as a spatiotemporal correlation structure, which is largely characterized by the tendency to compare the position of the flash in the past with the position of the moving item in the present.},

	abstract = {Due to its inherent neural delays, the visual system has an outdated access to sensory infor-mation about the current position of moving objects. In contrast, living organisms are remarkably able to track and intercept moving objects under a large range of challenging environmental conditions. Physiological, behavioral and psychophysical evidences strongly suggest that position coding is extrapolated using an explicit and reliable representation of object's motion but it is still unclear how these two representations interact. For instance, the so-called flash-lag effect supports the idea of a differential processing of position between moving and static objects. Although elucidating such mechanisms is crucial in our under-standing of the dynamics of visual processing, a theory is still missing to explain the different facets of this visual illusion. Here, we reconsider several of the key aspects of the flash-lag effect in order to explore the role of motion upon neural coding of objects' position. First, we formalize the problem using a Bayesian modeling framework which includes a graded repre-sentation of the degree of belief about visual motion. We introduce a motion-based predic-tion model as a candidate explanation for the perception of coherent motion. By including the knowledge of a fixed delay, we can model the dynamics of sensory information integra-tion by extrapolating the information acquired at previous instants in time. Next, we simulate the optimal estimation of object position with and without delay compensation and compared it with human perception under a broad range of different psychophysical conditions. Our computational study suggests that the explicit, probabilistic representation of velocity infor-mation is crucial in explaining position coding, and therefore the flash-lag effect. We discuss these theoretical results in light of the putative corrective mechanisms that can be used to cancel out the detrimental effects of neural delays and illuminate the more general question of the dynamical representation at the present time of spatial information in the visual pathways.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: When we view static scenes that imply motion - such as an object dropping off a shelf - recognition memory for the position of the object is extrapolated forward. It is as if the object in our mind's eye comes alive and continues on its course. This phenomenon is known as representational momentum and results in a distortion of recognition memory in the implied direction of motion. Representational momentum is modifiable; simply labelling a drawing of a pointed object as 'rocket' will facilitate the effect, whereas the label 'steeple' will impede it. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) to explore the neural substrate for representational momentum. {RESULTS}: Subjects participated in two experiments. In the first, they were presented with video excerpts of objects in motion (versus the same objects in a resting position). This identified brain areas responsible for motion perception. In the second experiment, they were presented with still photographs of the same target items, only some of which implied motion (representational momentum stimuli). When viewing still photographs of scenes implying motion, activity was revealed in secondary visual cortical regions that overlap with areas responsible for the perception of actual motion. Additional bilateral activity was revealed within a posterior satellite of V5 for the representational momentum stimuli. Activation was also engendered in the anterior cingulate cortex. {CONCLUSIONS}: Considering the implicit nature of representational momentum and its modifiability, the findings suggest that higher-order semantic information can act on secondary visual cortex to alter perception without explicit awareness.},

A rich body of literature has demonstrated that the position in which we perceive an object depends not only on retinotopy but also on factors such as attention, eye movements, object and scene motion, and frames of reference, to name a few. Despite the distinction between perceived and retinal position, strikingly little is known about how or where perceived position is represented in the brain. In the present study, we dissociated retinal and perceived object position to test the relative precision of retina-centered versus percept-centered position coding in a number of independently defined visual areas. In an {fMRI} experiment, subjects performed a five-alternative forced-choice position discrimination task; our analysis focused on the trials in which subjects misperceived the positions of the stimuli. Using a multivariate pattern analysis to track the coupling of the {BOLD} response with incremental changes in physical and perceived position, we found that activity in higher level areas–middle temporal complex, fusiform face area, parahippocampal place area, lateral occipital cortex, and posterior fusiform gyrus–more precisely reflected the reported positions than the physical positions of the stimuli. In early visual areas, this preferential coding of perceived position was absent or reversed. Our results demonstrate a new kind of spatial topography present in higher level visual areas in which an object's position is encoded according to its perceived rather than retinal location. We term such percept-centered encoding “perceptotopy".},

Although the literature provides sophisticated models of how the cerebellum helps refine movements, it remains unclear how the core mechanisms of these models can be applied when considering a broader conceptualization of cerebellar function.

	abstract = {Saccadic eye movements are shifts in the direction of gaze that rapidly and accurately aim the fovea at targets of interest. Saccades are so brief that visual feedback cannot guide them to their targets. Therefore, the saccadic motor command must be accurately specified in advance of the movement and continually modified to compensate for growth, injury, and aging, which otherwise would produce dysmetric saccades. When a persistent dysmetria occurs in subjects with muscle weakness or neural damage or is induced in normal primates by the surreptitious jumping of a target forward or backward as a saccade is made to acquire the target, saccadic amplitude changes to reduce the dysmetria. Adaptation of saccadic amplitude or direction occurs gradually and is retained in the dark, thus representing true motor plasticity. Saccadic adaptation is more rapid in humans than in monkeys, usually is incomplete in both species, and is slower and less robust for amplitude increases than decreases. Adaptation appears to be motor rather than sensory. In humans, adaptation of saccades that would seem to require more sensory-motor processing does not transfer to saccades that seem to require less, suggesting the existence of distributed adaptation loci. In monkeys, however, transfer from more simple to more complex saccades is robust, suggesting a common adaptation site. Neurophysiological data from both species indicate that the oculomotor cerebellum is crucial for saccadic adaptation. This review shows that the precise, voluntary behaviors known as saccadic eye movements provide an alternative to simple reflexes for the study of the neuronal basis of motor learning.},

In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the Kullback-Leibler ({KL}) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action-constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution-that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.},

Despite this seemingly obvious statement, many accounts of the neurobiology underpinning visual perception fail to consider the active nature of how we sample our sensory world. This review offers an overview of the neurobiology of visual perception, which begins with the control of saccadic eye movements. Starting from here, we can follow the anatomy backwards, to try to understand the functional architecture of neuronal networks that support the interrogation of a visual scene. Many of the principles encountered in this exercise are equally applicable to other perceptual modalities. For example, the somatosensory system, like the visual system, requires the sampling of data through mobile receptive epithelia. Analysis of a somatosensory scene depends on what is palpated, in much the same way that visual analysis relies on what is foveated. The discussion here is structured around the anatomical systems involved in active vision and visual scene construction, but will use these systems to introduce some general theoretical considerations. We will additionally highlight points of contact between the biology and the pathophysiology that has been proposed to cause a clinical disorder of scene construction – spatial hemineglect.},

	abstract = {This year, the field of neuroscience celebrates the 50th anniversary of Mountcastle's discovery of the cortical column. In this review, we summarize half a century of research and come to the disappointing realization that the column may have no function. Originally, it was described as a discrete structure, spanning the layers of the somatosensory cortex, which contains cells responsive to only a single modality, such as deep joint receptors or cutaneous receptors. Subsequently, examples of columns have been uncovered in numerous cortical areas, expanding the original concept to embrace a variety of different structures and principles. A "column" now refers to cells in any vertical cluster that share the same tuning for any given receptive field attribute. In striate cortex, for example, cells with the same eye preference are grouped into ocular dominance columns. Unaccountably, ocular dominance columns are present in some species, but not others. In principle, it should be possible to determine their function by searching for species differences in visual performance that correlate with their presence or absence. Unfortunately, this approach has been to no avail; no visual faculty has emerged that appears to require ocular dominance columns. Moreover, recent evidence has shown that the expression of ocular dominance columns can be highly variable among members of the same species, or even in different portions of the visual cortex in the same individual. These observations deal a fatal blow to the idea that ocular dominance columns serve a purpose. More broadly, the term "column" also denotes the periodic termination of anatomical projections within or between cortical areas. In many instances, periodic projections have a consistent relationship with some architectural feature, such as the cytochrome oxidase patches in V1 or the stripes in V2. These tissue compartments appear to divide cells with different receptive field properties into distinct processing streams. However, it is unclear what advantage, if any, is conveyed by this form of columnar segregation. Although the column is an attractive concept, it has failed as a unifying principle for understanding cortical function. Unravelling the organization of the cerebral cortex will require a painstaking description of the circuits, projections and response properties peculiar to cells in each of its various areas.},

It is inspired by the phenomenon of consciousness seen as the formation of a low-dimensional combination of a few concepts constituting a conscious thought, i.e., consciousness as awareness at a particular time instant. This provides a powerful constraint on the representation in that such low-dimensional thought vectors can correspond to statements about reality which are true, highly probable, or very useful for taking decisions. The fact that a few elements of the current state can be combined into such a predictive or useful statement is a strong constraint and deviates considerably from the maximum likelihood approaches to modelling data and how states unfold in the future based on an agent's actions. Instead of making predictions in the sensory (e.g. pixel) space, the consciousness prior allows the agent to make predictions in the abstract space, with only a few dimensions of that space being involved in each of these predictions. The consciousness prior also makes it natural to map conscious states to natural language utterances or to express classical {AI} knowledge in the form of facts and rules, although the conscious states may be richer than what can be expressed easily in the form of a sentence, a fact or a rule.},

Subjects viewed a sinusoidal target, with or without random fluctuations in its motion. Eye trajectories and magnetoencephalographic ({MEG}) data were recorded concurrently. The target was periodically occluded, such that its reappearance caused a visual evoked response field ({ERF}). Dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}) was used to fit models of eye trajectories and the {ERFs}. The {DCM} for pursuit was based on predictive coding and active inference, and predicts subjects' eye movements based on their (subjective) Bayesian beliefs about target (and eye) motion. The precisions of these hierarchical beliefs can be inferred from behavioural (pursuit) data. The {DCM} for {MEG} data used an established biophysical model of neuronal activity that includes parameters for the gain of superficial pyramidal cells, which is thought to encode precision at the neuronal level. Previous studies (using {DCM} of pursuit data) suggest that noisy target motion increases subjective precision at the sensory level: i.e., subjects attend more to the target's sensory attributes. We compared (noisy motion-induced) changes in the synaptic gain based on the modelling of {MEG} data to changes in subjective precision estimated using the pursuit data. We demonstrate that imprecise target motion increases the gain of superficial pyramidal cells in V1 (across subjects). Furthermore, increases in sensory precision - inferred by our behavioural {DCM} - correlate with the increase in gain in V1, across subjects. This is a step towards a fully integrated model of brain computations, cortical responses and behaviour that may provide a useful clinical tool in conditions like schizophrenia.},

This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle–the minimisation of variational free energy–to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements–prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {Natural images contain often curvilinear structures, which might be disconnected, or partly occluded. Recovering the missing connection of disconnected structures is an open issue and needs appropriate geometric reasoning. We propose to find line co-occurrence statistics from the centerlines of blood vessels in retinal images and show its remarkable similarity to a well-known probabilistic model for the connectivity pattern in the primary visual cortex. Furthermore, the probabilistic model is trained from the data via statistics and used for automated grouping of interrupted vessels in a spectral clustering based approach. Several challenging image patches are investigated around junction points, where successful results indicate the perfect match of the trained model to the profiles of blood vessels in retinal images. Also, comparisons among several statistical models obtained from different datasets reveals their high similarity i.e., they are independent of the dataset. On top of that, the best approximation of the statistical model with the symmetrized extension of the probabilistic model on the projective line bundle is found with a least square error smaller than 2\%. Apparently, the direction process on the projective line bundle is a good continuation model for vessels in retinal images.},

	abstract = {Although it is known that a moving stimulus appears to dilate in duration compared to a stationary stimulus, whether subjective motion devoid of stimulus motion is sufficient remains unknown. To elucidate this, we used a motion illusion in which an actually static stimulus clearly appears to move, a useful dissociation between actual and subjective motions. We used the jitter aftereffect resulting from adaptation to dynamic noise as such a tool and measured subjective durations of a static random-dot pattern in which illusory jitter was seen, an actually oscillating pattern mimicking the illusory jitter, and a static pattern without illusory jitter. Pattern oscillation as tiny as fixational eye movements robustly evoked time dilation, and time dilation to a similar extent was also induced by an actually static but subjectively jittering pattern. Taken together with the previous knowledge that this subjective jitter is related to a visually based compensation of spurious retinal image motions due to fixational eye movements, these findings demonstrate that visual duration computation is influenced by a representation at a high-level motion processing stage at which a stable visual world despite jittery retinal inputs has been established.

	abstract = {The responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex to sinusoidal gratings can primarily be predicted from their spatial receptive fields, as mapped using spots or bars. Although this quasilinearity is well documented, it is not clear whether it holds for complex natural stimuli. We recorded from simple cells in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized ferrets while stimulating with flashed digitized photographs of natural scenes. We applied standard reverse-correlation methods to quantify the average natural stimulus that invokes a neuronal response. Although these maps cannot be the receptive fields, we find that they still predict the preferred orientation of grating for each cell very well (r = 0.91); they do not predict the spatial-frequency tuning. Using a novel application of the linear reconstruction method called regularized pseudoinverse, we were able to recover high-resolution receptive-field maps from the responses to a relatively small number of natural scenes. These receptive-field maps not only predict the optimum orientation of each cell (r = 0.96) but also the spatial-frequency optimum (r = 0.89); the maps also predict the tuning bandwidths of many cells. Therefore, our first conclusion is that the tuning preferences of the cells are primarily linear and constant across stimulus type. However, when we used these maps to predict the actual responses of the cells to natural scenes, we did find evidence of expansive output nonlinearity and nonlinear influences from outside the classical receptive fields, orientation tuning, and spatial-frequency tuning.},

	abstract = {Three experiments are reported that examined the abilities of human observers to discriminate textures with identical distributions of orientation and spatial frequency. In Experiment 1, the stimuli consisted of low-pass filtered noise that was uniformly distributed and spatially isotropic. Observers were able to discriminate textures with identical image statistics when their frequencies were 1 cpd or less, but performance dropped off sharply for textures with higher frequencies. In Experiment 2, a novel procedure was employed with which it is possible to increase the high-frequency energy in the amplitude spectrum of a texture, while preserving the macroscopic alignments of its phase spectrum. The results reveal that this has little effect on performance, thus indicating that it is not spatial frequency per se that limits the abilities of observers to discriminate macroscopic texture patterns. When the phase spectra of these textures were randomly scrambled in Experiment 3, the frequency thresholds for discriminating textures reverted back to 1 cpd as was obtained in Experiment 1. These results provide strong evidence that human observers make use of two distinct procedures for discriminating patches of texture: One based on image statistics that is possible for all textures; and another based on macroscopic phase alignments that define features that are larger than 1 deg.},

	abstract = {Human medial occipital cortex comprises multiple visual areas, each with a distinct retinotopic representation of visual environment. We measured spatial frequency ({SF}) tuning curves with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and found consistent differences between these areas. Areas V1, V2, {VP}, V3, V4v, and V3A were all band-pass tuned, with progressively lower {SF} optima in V1, V2, and V3A. In {VP} and V3, the {SF} optima were similar to optima in V2, whereas V4v showed more individual variation and scattered {SF} representations on the cortical surface. Area V5+ showed low-pass {SF} tuning. In each area, the {SF} optimum declined with increasing eccentricity. After accounting for the cortical magnification, the cortical extent of the optimal spatial wavelengths was approximately constant across eccentricity in V1, which suggests an anatomical constraint for the optimal {SF}, and this extent is actually comparable to the extent of horizontal connections within primate V1. The optimal spatial wavelengths in the visual field are also of similar extent to the spatial summation fields of macaque V1. The progressive decline in the {SF} tuning from V1 to V2 and V3A is compatible with the view that these areas represent visual information at different spatial scales.},

To study the neuronal basis to extract these features, we conducted extracellular recordings while two macaque monkeys performed a fixation task. Angle stimuli were the combination of two straight half-lines larger than the size of the classical receptive fields ({CRFs}). Each line was drawn from the center to outside the {CRFs} in 1 of 12 directions, so that the stimuli passed through the {CRFs} and formed angles at the center of the {CRFs}. Of 114 neurons recorded from the superficial layer of area V2, 91 neurons showed selective responses to these angle stimuli. Of these, 41 neurons (36.0\%) showed selective responses to wide angles between 60° and 150° that were distinct from responses to straight lines or sharp angles (30°). Responses were highly selective to a particular angle in approximately one-fourth of neurons. When we tested the selectivity of the same neurons to individual half-lines, the preferred direction was more or less consistent with one or two components of the optimal angle stimuli. These results suggest that the selectivity of the neurons depends on both the combination of two components and the responses to individual components. Angle-selective V2 neurons are unlikely to be specific angle detectors, because the magnitude of their responses to the optimal angle was indistinguishable from that to the optimal half-lines. We suggest that the extraction of information of angles embedded within contour stimuli may start in area V2.},

The 2D and 3D {MAEs} obtained in equiluminant color gratings showed that the visual system has the low-level motion mechanism for color motion as well as for luminance motion. The 3D {MAE} is an {MAE} for motion in depth after monocular motion adaptation. Apparent 3D motion can be perceived after prolonged exposure of one eye to lateral motion because the difference in motion signal between the adapted and unadapted eyes generates interocular velocity differences ({IOVDs}). Since {IOVDs} cannot be analyzed by the high-level motion mechanism of feature tracking, we conclude that a low-level motion mechanism is responsible for the 3D {MAE}. Since we found different temporal frequency characteristics between the color and luminance stimuli, {MAEs} in the equiluminant color stimuli cannot be attributed to a residual luminance component in the color stimulus. Although a similar {MAE} was found with a luminance and a color test both for 2D and 3D motion judgments after adapting to either color or luminance motion, temporal frequency characteristics were different between the color and luminance adaptation. The visual system must have a low-level motion mechanism for color signals as for luminance ones. We also found that color and luminance motion signals are integrated monocularly before {IOVD} analysis, showing a cross adaptation effect between color and luminance stimuli. This was supported by an experiment with dichoptic presentations of color and luminance tests. In the experiment, color and luminance tests were presented in the different eyes dichoptically with four different combinations of test and adaptation: color or luminance test in the adapted eye after color or luminance adaptation. Findings of little or no influence of the adaptation/test combinations indicate the integration of color and luminance motion signals prior to the binocular {IOVD} process.},

To determine how they manage to do so, we explored how various factors that we could manipulate influenced people's precision when intercepting virtual targets. We found that temporal precision was highest for fast targets that subjects were free to intercept wherever they wished. Temporal precision was much poorer when the point of interception was specified in advance. Examining responses to abrupt perturbations of the target's motion revealed that people adjusted where rather than when they would hit the target if given the choice. A model that combines judging how long it will take to reach the target's path with estimating the target's position at that time from its visually perceived position and velocity could account for the observed precision with reasonable values for all the parameters. The model considers all relevant sources of errors, together with the delays with which the various aspects can be adjusted. Our analysis provides a biologically plausible explanation for how light falling on the eye can guide the hand to intercept a moving ball with such high precision.},

This problem is complicated by the large dimensionality of the inputs. To cope with this problem, previous methods have estimated simplified versions of a generic linear-nonlinear ({LN}) model and required, in most cases, stimuli with constrained statistics. Here we develop the extended Projection Pursuit Regression ({ePPR}) algorithm that allows the estimation of all of the parameters, in space and time, of a generic {LN} model using arbitrary stimuli. We first prove that {ePPR} models can uniformly approximate, to an arbitrary degree of precision, any continuous function. To test this generality empirically, we use {ePPR} to recover the parameters of models of cortical cells that cannot be represented exactly with an {ePPR} model. Next we evaluate {ePPR} with physiological data from primary visual cortex, and show that it can characterize both simple and complex cells, from their responses to both natural and random stimuli. For both simulated and physiological data, we show that {ePPR} compares favorably to spike-triggered and information-theoretic techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this article contains the first demonstration of a method that allows the estimation of an {LN} model of visual cells, containing multiple spatio-temporal filters, from their responses to natural stimuli.},

It is based on the notion that the brain is an organ of inference that ac- tively constructs hypotheses to explain or predict its sensations. This perspec- tive provides a normative (Bayes optimal) account of action and perception that emphasises probabilistic representations; in particular, the confidence or precision of beliefs about the world. We consider sensory attenuation deficits, catatonia and delusions as various expressions of the same core pathology: namely, an aberrant encoding of precision in a predictive coding hierarchy. In predictive coding, precision is thought to be encoded by the postsynaptic gain of neurons reporting prediction error. This suggests that both pervasive trait abnormalities and florid failures of inference in the psychotic state can be linked to factors controlling postsynaptic gain—such as {NMDA} receptor func- tion and (dopaminergic) neuromodulation. We illustrate these points using a biologically plausible simulation of attribution of agency—showing how a reduction in the precision of prior beliefs, relative to sensory evidence, can lead to false inference.},

	abstract = {1. Using the two-dimensional (2D) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as 2D Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found 2D Gabor filters that fit the 2D spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the 2D spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent 2D spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the 2D Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the 2D spatial and spatial frequency domains.},

I will then argue that a purely Helmholtzian is limited, in that it can account only account for agency in the context of perceptual inference. The cybernetic account cannot give a full account of action, since purposiveness is accounted for only to the extent that it pertains to the control of homeostatic essential variables. I will then argue that the enactive affordance-based account attempts to provide broader account of purposive action without presupposing goals and intentions coming from outside of the theory.

	abstract = {—Here we present an array of leaky integrate-and-fire ({LIF}) neuron circuits designed for the second-generation {BrainScaleS} mixed-signal 65-nm {CMOS} neuromorphic hardware. The neuronal array is embedded in the analog network core of a scaled-down prototype {HICANN}-{DLS} chip. Designed as continuous-time circuits, the neurons are highly tunable and reconfigurable elements with accelerated dynamics. Each neuron integrates input current from a multitude of incoming synapses and evokes a digital spike event output. The circuit offers a wide tuning range for synaptic and membrane time constants, as well as for refractory periods to cover a number of computational models. We elucidate our design methodology, underlying circuit design, calibration and measurement results from individual sub-circuits across multiple dies. The circuit dynamics match with the behavior of the {LIF} mathematical model. We further demonstrate a winner-take-all network on the prototype chip as a typical element of cortical processing.

Furthermore, we introduce a stochastic process based on a probability distribution function to move in targeted directions rather than on a summation of influential vectors as is classically assumed by most models. In parallel, we present experimental results of zebrafish (alone or in group of 10) swimming in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments. We use these experimental data to set the parameter values of our model and show that this perception-based approach can simulate the collective motion of species showing cohesive behaviour in heterogeneous environments.

The retinotopic locus of V4 activity evoked by the flashed element shifted along the motion trajectory. The magnitude of the shift is consistent with the perceptual shift in humans viewing identical stimuli. This retinotopic distortion depended on the presence of a flashed element but was observed for both color-selective and non-color-selective neurons. The distortion was undiminished when the flashed element terminated the sequence, a condition that reduced the perceptual shift in humans. These findings are consistent with a Bayesian model of localization in which perceived location is derived from position signals optimally integrated across visual areas. ??2006 Elsevier Inc.},

Instead, the brain is a Bayesian sampler. Only with infinite samples does a Bayesian sampler conform to the laws of probability; with finite samples it systematically generates classic probabilistic reasoning errors, including the unpacking effect, base-rate neglect, and the conjunction fallacy.},

We propose an approach that expresses information gain in terms of predictive entropies, and apply this method to the Gaussian Process Classifier ({GPC}). Our approach makes minimal approximations to the full information theoretic objective. Our experimental performance compares favourably to many popular active learning algorithms, and has equal or lower computational complexity. We compare well to decision theoretic approaches also, which are privy to more information and require much more computational time. Secondly, by developing further a reformulation of binary preference learning to a classification problem, we extend our algorithm to Gaussian Process preference learning.},

We evaluate the conditions required for this regime to exist and determine the properties of networks operating within it. A plausible synaptic plasticity rule for learning that balances weight configurations is presented. Our theory predicts an optimal ratio of the number of excitatory and inhibitory synapses for maximizing the encoding capacity of balanced networks for given statistics of afferent activations.

	abstract = {{SUMMARY} In conventional single-component data acquisition, a common way to solve the problem of reconstructing aliased seismic data is to use priors that are computed at low frequencies and applied at high frequencies. In contrast, parametric matching pursuit methods such as Generalized Matching Pursuit applied on multicomponent data do not need priors in most conditions to achieve accurate reconstruction under aliasing. In this paper, we examine how and when soft priors can provide further robustness to multichannel matching pursuit algorithms. We illustrate our concepts on synthetic data generated by finite-difference modelling and on data acquired by a 3D-4C towed cable array. We find that multicomponent data allow matching pursuit algorithms to compute and use the priors in ways that are not possible with single-component data. For instance, the priors can be estimated by matching pursuit within an intermediate temporal frequency band, where the signal-to-noise ratios of all the components are high, while the data are already subject to spatial aliasing. The priors generated at these intermediate frequencies can then be used at higher frequencies where the aliasing is stronger, and also at lower frequencies, still aliased and affected by stronger noise.},

	abstract = {When attention is directed to a region of space, visual resolution at that location flexibly adapts, becoming sharper to resolve fine-scale details or coarser to reflect large-scale texture and surface properties [1]. By what mechanism does attention improve spatial resolution? An improved signal-to-noise ratio ({SNR}) at the attended location contributes [2], because of retinotopically specific signal gain [3-10]. Additionally, attention could sharpen position tuning at the neural population level, so that adjacent objects activate more distinct regions of the visual cortex. A dual mechanism involving both signal gain and sharpened position tuning would be highly efficient at improving visual resolution, but there is no direct evidence that attention can narrow the position tuning of population responses. Here, we compared the spatial spread of the {fMRI} {BOLD} response for attended versus ignored stimuli. The activity produced by adjacent stimuli overlapped less when subjects were attending at their locations versus attending elsewhere, despite a stronger peak response with attention. Our results show that even as early as primary visual cortex (V1), spatially directed attention narrows the tuning of population-coded position representations. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Motion signals in the visual field can cause strong biases in the perceived positions of stationary objects. Local motion signal within an object induces a shift in the perceived object position in the direction of motion, whereas adaptation to motion stimuli causes a perceptual shift in the opposite direction. The neural mechanisms underlying these illusions are poorly understood. Here we report two novel receptive field ({RF}) properties in cat primary visual cortex that may account for these motion-position illusions. First, motion signal in a stationary test stimulus causes a displacement of the {RF} in the direction opposite to motion. Second, motion adaptation induces a shift of the {RF} in the direction of adaptation. Comparison with human psychophysical measurements under similar conditions indicates that these {RF} properties can primarily account for the motion-position illusions. Importantly, both {RF} properties indicate a spatial asymmetry in the synaptic connections from direction-selective cells, and this circuit feature can be predicted by spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity, a widespread phenomenon in the nervous system. Thus, motion-induced perceptual mislocalization may be mediated by asymmetric cortical circuits, as a natural consequence of experience-dependent synaptic modification during circuit development.},

	abstract = {Two trends have been unfolding in computational neuroscience during the last decade. First, a shift of focus to increasingly complex and heterogeneous neural network models, with a concomitant increase in the level of collaboration within the field (whether direct or in the form of building on top of existing tools and results). Second, a general trend in science towards more open communication, both internally, with other potential scientific collaborators, and externally, with the wider public. This multi-faceted development towards more integrative approaches and more intense communication within and outside of the field poses major new challenges for modellers, as currently there is a severe lack of tools to help with automatic communication and sharing of all aspects of a simulation workflow to the rest of the community. To address this important gap in the current computational modeling software infrastructure, here we introduce Arkheia. Arkheia is a web-based open science platform for computational models in systems neuroscience. It provides an automatic, interactive, graphical presentation of simulation results, experimental protocols, and interactive exploration of parameter searches, in a web browser-based application. Arkheia is focused on automatic presentation of these resources with minimal manual input from users. Arkheia is written in a modular fashion with a focus on future development of the platform. The platform is designed in an open manner, with a clearly defined and separated {API} for database access, so that any project can write its own backend translating its data into the Arkheia database format. Arkheia is not a centralized platform, but allows any user (or group of users) to set up their own repository, either for public access by the general population, or locally for internal use. Overall, Arkheia provides users with an automatic means to communicate information about not only their models but also individual simulation results and the entire experimental context in an approachable graphical manner, thus facilitating the user's ability to collaborate in the field and outreach to a wider audience.},

It is lightly myelinated and lacks the clearly defined six-layer structure evident throughout the cerebral cortex, with a thinner layer 4 and thicker layer 2 [10], characteristic of limbic cortex [11]. In the marmoset and rhesus monkey, area prostriata has cortical connections with {MT}+ [12], the cingulate motor cortex [8], the auditory cortex [13], the orbitofrontal cortex, and the frontal polar cortices [14]. Here we use functional magnetic resonance together with a wide-field projection system to study its functional properties in humans. With population receptive field mapping [15], we show that area prostriata has a complete representation of the visual field, clearly distinct from the adjacent area V1. As in the marmoset, the caudal-dorsal border of human prostriata-abutting V1-represents the far peripheral visual field, with eccentricities decreasing toward its rostral boundary. Area prostriata responds strongly to very fast motion, greater than 500°/s. The functional properties of area prostriata suggest that it may serve to alert the brain quickly to fast visual events, particularly in the peripheral visual field.},

At the first stage, the observation vectors Yi for units i = 1, {\textbackslash}ldots, k are independently distributed with densities p(yi {\textbar} \$þeta\$i ), or more generally, p(yi {\textbar} \$þeta\$i, λ). At the second stage, the unit-specific parameter vectors \$þeta\$i are iid with densities p(\$þeta\$i {\textbar} λ). The {PEB} approach proceeds by regarding the second-stage distribution as a prior and noting that, if λ were known, inference about \$þeta\$ could be based on its posterior. Since λ is not known, the simplest {PEB} methods estimate the parameter λ by maximum likelihood or some variant, and then treat λ as if it were known to be equal to this estimate. Although this procedure is sometimes satisfactory, a well-known defect is that it neglects the uncertainty due to the estimation of λ. In this article w...},

	abstract = {—This paper presents a massively parallel and scalable neuromorphic cortex simulator designed for simulating large and structurally connected spiking neural networks, such as complex models of various areas of the cortex. The main novelty of this work is the abstraction of a neuromorphic architecture into clusters represented by minicolumns and hypercolumns, analogously to the fundamental structural units observed in neurobiology. Without this approach, simulating large-scale fully connected networks needs prohibitively large memory to store look-up tables for point-to-point connections. Instead, we use a novel architecture, based on the structural connectivity in the neocortex, such that all the required parameters and connections can be stored in on-chip memory. The cortex simulator can be easily reconfigured for simulating different neural networks without any change in hardware structure by programming the memory. A hierarchical communication scheme allows one neuron to have a fan-out of up to 200k neurons. As a proof-of-concept, an implementation on one Altera Stratix V {FPGA} was able to simulate 20 million to 2.6 billion leaky-integrate-and-fire ({LIF}) neurons in real time. We verified the system by emulating a simplified auditory cortex (with 100 million neurons). This cortex simulator achieved a low power dissipation of 1.62 μW per neuron. With the advent of commercially available {FPGA} boards, our system offers an accessible and scalable tool for the design, real-time simulation, and analysis of large-scale spiking neural networks.},

We present a network model of conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons inspired by the architecture of retinotopic cortical areas that assumes predictive coding is implemented through network connectivity, namely in the connection delays and in selectiveness for the tuning properties of source and target cells. We show that the applied connection pattern leads to motion-based prediction in an experiment tracking a moving dot. In contrast to our proposed model, a network with random or isotropic connectivity fails to predict the path when the moving dot disappears. Furthermore, we show that a simple linear decoding approach is sufficient to transform neuronal spiking activity into a probabilistic estimate for reading out the target trajectory.},

Here, we use two-photon calcium imaging and electrophysiology in head-fixed walking flies to identify a different neural population that conjunctively encodes heading and angular velocity, and is excited selectively by turns in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. We show how these mirror-symmetric turn responses combine with the neurons' connectivity to the compass neurons to create an elegant mechanism for updating the fly's heading representation when the animal turns in darkness. This mechanism, which employs recurrent loops with an angular shift, bears a resemblance to those proposed in theoretical models for rodent head direction cells.

	abstract = {Millions of images on the web enable us to explore images from social events such as a family party, thus it is of interest to understand and model the affect exhibited by a group of people in images. But analysis of the affect expressed by multiple people is challenging due to varied indoor and outdoor settings, and interactions taking place between various numbers of people. A few existing works on Group-level Emotion Recognition ({GER}) have investigated on face-level information. Due to the challenging environments, face may not provide enough information to {GER}. Relatively few studies have investigated multi-modal {GER}. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-modal approach based on a new feature description for understanding emotional state of a group of people in an image. In this paper, we firstly exploit three kinds of rich information containing face, upperbody and scene in a group-level image. Furthermore, in order to integrate multiple person's information in a group-level image, we propose an information aggregation method to generate three features for face, upperbody and scene, respectively. We fuse face, upperbody and scene information for robustness of {GER} against the challenging environments. Intensive experiments are performed on two challenging group-level emotion databases to investigate the role of face, upperbody and scene as well as multi-modal framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves very promising performance for {GER}.},

Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input. We discuss its links to feedback from the cortical motion area {MT} (V5), and suggest that motion perception involves a dynamic interplay between {MT}, V1 and the thalamus.

Grey matter loss and white matter changes, including the corpus callosum, likely underlie cognitive and executive function deficits in {DM} patients. However, little is known how cerebral cortical circuitry changes in {DM}. Here, flavoprotein optical imaging was used to assess local and contralateral responses to intracortical motor cortex stimulation in {DM}-related mouse models. In control mice, brief train stimulation generated ipsilateral and contralateral homotopic fluorescence increases, the latter mediated by the corpus callosum. Single pulse stimulation produced an excitatory response with an inhibitory-like surround response mediated by {GABAA} receptors. In a mouse model of {DM}2 (Mbnl2 {KO}), we observed prolonged and increased responsiveness to train stimulation and loss of the inhibition from single pulse stimulation. Conversely, mice overexpressing human {MBNL}1 ({MBNL}1-{OE}) exhibited decreased contralateral response to train stimulation and reduction of inhibitory-like surround to single pulse stimulation. Therefore, altering levels of two key {DM}-associated splicing factors modifies functions of local cortical circuits and contralateral responses mediated through the corpus callosum.},

Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain's capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of dyshomeostasis and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behaviour), the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis may trigger a generalised belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue in the future.},

Here, we discuss a proof-of-principle implementation of the active inference scheme for the control or the 7-{DoF} arm of a (simulated) {PR}2 robot. By manipulating visual and proprioceptive noise levels, we show under which conditions robot control under the active inference scheme is accurate. Besides accurate control, our analysis of the internal system dynamics (e.g. the dynamics of the hidden states that are inferred during the inference) sheds light on key aspects of the framework such as the quintessentially multimodal nature of control and the differential roles of proprioception and vision. In the discussion, we consider the potential importance of being able to implement active inference in robots. In particular, we briefly review the opportunities for modelling psychophysiological phenomena such as sensory attenuation and related failures of gain control, of the sort seen in Parkinson's disease. We also consider the fundamental difference between active inference and optimal control formulations, showing that in the former the heavy lifting shifts from solving a dynamical inverse problem to creating deep forward or generative models with dynamics, whose attracting sets prescribe desired behaviours.},

This issue is particularly important because a tendency to sample less information (often known as reflection impulsivity) is a feature in several psychopathologies, such as psychosis. A formal understanding of information sampling may therefore clarify the computational anatomy of psychopathology. In this theoretical letter, we consider evidence accumulation in terms of active (Bayesian) inference using a generic model of Markov decision processes. Here, agents are equipped with beliefs about their own behavior–in this case, that they will make informed decisions. Normative decision making is then modeled using variational Bayes to minimize surprise about choice outcomes. Under this scheme, different facets of belief updating map naturally onto the functional anatomy of the brain (at least at a heuristic level). Of particular interest is the key role played by the expected precision of beliefs about control, which we have previously suggested may be encoded by dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain. We show that manipulating expected precision strongly affects how much information an agent characteristically samples, and thus provides a possible link between impulsivity and dopaminergic dysfunction. Our study therefore represents a step toward understanding evidence accumulation in terms of neurobiologically plausible Bayesian inference and may cast light on why this process is disordered in psychopathology.},

We use simulations of abstract rule learning and approximate Bayesian inference to show that minimizing (expected) variational free energy leads to active sampling of novel contingencies. This epistemic behavior closes explanatory gaps in generative models of the world, thereby reducing uncertainty and satisfying curiosity.

To substantiate this claim, we present neuronal simulations that show the same representations can prescribe motor behavior and encode motor intentions during action–observation. These simulations are based on the free-energy formulation of active inference, which is formally related to predictive coding. In this scheme, (generalised) states of the world are represented as trajectories. When these states include motor trajectories they implicitly entail intentions (future motor states). Optimizing the representation of these intentions enables predictive coding in a prospective sense. Crucially, the same generative models used to make predictions can be deployed to predict the actions of self or others by simply changing the bias or precision (i.e. attention) afforded to proprioceptive signals. We illustrate these points using simulations of handwriting to illustrate neuronally plausible generation and recognition of itinerant (wandering) motor trajectories. We then use the same simulations to produce synthetic electrophysiological responses to violations of intentional expectations. Our results affirm that a Bayes-optimal approach provides a principled framework, which accommodates current thinking about the mirror-neuron system. Furthermore, it endorses the general formulation of action as active inference.},

	abstract = {According to active inference (which subsumes the framework of predictive processing), action is enabled by a top-down modulation of sensory signals. Computational models of this mechanism complement ideomotor theories of action representation. Such theories postulate common neural representations for action and perception, without specifying how action is enabled by such representations. In active inference, motor commands are replaced by proprioceptive predictions. In order to initiate action through such predictions, sensory prediction errors have to be attenuated. This paper argues that such top-down modulation involves systematic (but paradoxically beneficial) misrepresentations. More specifically, the paper first argues for the following conditional claim. If active inference provides an accurate computational description of how action is enabled in the brain, then action is enabled by systematic misrepresentations. Furthermore, it is argued that an inference to the best explanation provides reason for believing the antecedent is true: Firstly, active inference provides a crucial extension to ideomotor theories. Secondly, active inference explains otherwise puzzling phenomena related to sensory attenuation, e.g. in force-matching or self-tickling paradigms. Taken together, these reasons support the claim that action is indeed enabled by systematic misrepresentations. The claim casts doubt on the assumption that representations are systematically beneficial to the extent that they are true: if the argument in this paper is sound, systematically beneficial misrepresentations may lie at the heart of our neural architecture.},

We show that optimal control can be cast as active inference. In active inference, both action and posterior beliefs about hidden states minimise a free energy bound on the negative log-likelihood of observed states, under a generative model. In this setting, reward or cost functions are absorbed into prior beliefs about state transitions and terminal states. Effectively, this converts optimal control into a pure inference problem, enabling the application of standard Bayesian filtering techniques. We then consider optimal trajectories that rest on posterior beliefs about hidden states in the future. Crucially, this entails modelling control as a hidden state that endows the generative model with a representation of agency. This leads to a distinction between models with and without inference on hidden control states; namely, agency-free and agency-based models, respectively.},

	abstract = {Ocular smooth pursuit and fixation are typically viewed as separate systems, yet there is evidence that the brainstem fixation system inhibits pursuit. Here we present behavioral evidence that the fixation system modulates pursuit behavior outside of conscious awareness. Human observers (male and female) either pursued a small spot that translated across a screen, or fixated it as it remained stationary. As shown previously, pursuit trials potentiated the oculomotor system, producing anticipatory eye velocity on the next trial before the target moved that mimicked the stimulus-driven velocity. Randomly interleaving fixation trials reduced anticipatory pursuit, suggesting that a potentiated fixation system interacted with pursuit to suppress eye velocity in upcoming pursuit trials. The reduction was not due to passive decay of the potentiated pursuit signal because interleaving "blank" trials in which no target appeared did not reduce anticipatory pursuit. Interspersed short fixation trials reduced anticipation on long pursuit trials, suggesting that fixation potentiation was stronger than pursuit potentiation. Furthermore, adding more pursuit trials to a block did not restore anticipatory pursuit, suggesting that fixation potentiation was not overridden by certainty of an imminent pursuit trial but rather was immune to conscious intervention. To directly test if cognition can override fixation suppression, we alternated pursuit and fixation trials to perfectly specify trial identity. Still, anticipatory pursuit did not rise above that observed with an equal number of random fixation trials. The results suggest that potentiated fixation circuitry interacts with pursuit circuitry at a subconscious level to inhibit pursuit.{SignificanceWhen} an object moves, we view it with smooth pursuit eye movements. When an object is stationary, we view it with fixational eye movements. Pursuit and fixation are historically regarded as controlled by different neural circuitry, and alternating between invoking them is thought to be guided by a conscious decision. However, our results show that pursuit is actively suppressed by prior fixation of a stationary object. This suppression is involuntary, and cannot be avoided even if observers are certain that the object will move. The results suggest that the neural fixation circuitry is potentiated by engaging stationary objects, and interacts with pursuit outside of conscious awareness.},

To solve these problems, we propose a novel algorithm which involves separation of background images to minimize the influence of noise, non-uniformed illuminations and lesions. We develop two different strategies to segment thin and thick blood vessels. Thin blood vessels are identified by taking benefits of local phase-preserving denoising, line detection, local normalization and maximum entropy thresholding. To remove noise and preserve detailed blood vessels information, phase-preserving denoising technique is used. The technology takes an advantage of log-Gabor wavelet responses in the complex domain to preserve the phase information of the image. Thick vessels are extracted and binarized via maximum entropy thresholding. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on four popular databases ({DRIVE}, {STARE}, {CHASE}\_ {DB}1, {HRF}).

These contextual effects are hard to reconcile with classical theories and have inspired accounts where contextual influences play a crucial role. However, each account only addresses one or the other of the empirical findings and a unifying perspective has been elusive. Here, we offer a unifying theory of context effects on incentive value attribution and choice based on normative Bayesian principles. This formulation assumes that incentive value corresponds to a precision-weighted prediction error, where predictions are based upon expectations about reward. We show that this scheme explains a wide range of contextual effects, such as those elicited by other options available during choice (or within-choice context effects). These include both conditions in which choice requires an integration of multiple attributes and conditions where a multi-attribute integration is not necessary. Moreover, the same scheme explains context effects elicited by options presented in the past or between-choice context effects. Our formulation encompasses a wide range of contextual influences (comprising both within- and between-choice effects) by calling on Bayesian principles, without invoking ad-hoc assumptions. This helps clarify the contextual nature of incentive value and choice behaviour and may offer insights into psychopathologies characterized by dysfunctional decision-making, such as addiction and pathological gambling.},

Neuropsychological studies of time perception in patient groups and functional neuroimaging studies of timing in normal participants suggest common neural substrates for perceptual and motor timing. A timing system is implicated in core regions of the motor network such as the cerebellum, inferior olive, basal ganglia, pre-supplementary, and supplementary motor area, pre-motor cortex as well as higher-level areas such as the prefrontal cortex. In this article, we assess how distinct parts of the timing system subserve different aspects of perceptual timing. We previously established brain bases for absolute, duration-based timing and relative, beat-based timing in the olivocerebellar and striato-thalamo-cortical circuits respectively (Teki et al., 2011). However, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies provide a basis to suggest that timing functions of these circuits may not be independent. Here, we propose a unified model of time perception based on coordinated activity in the core striatal and olivocerebellar networks that are interconnected with each other and the cerebral cortex through multiple synaptic pathways. Timing in this unified model is proposed to involve serial beat-based striatal activation followed by absolute olivocerebellar timing mechanisms.},

However, these models were usually tested in different tasks, and it is then difficult to compare their efficiency for an autonomous animat. We present here the comparison of four architectures in an animat as it performs the same reward-seeking task. This will illustrate the consequences of different hypotheses about the management of different Actor sub-modules and Critic units, and their more or less autonomously determined coordination. We show that the classical method of coordination of modules by mixture of experts, depending on each module's performance, did not allow solving our task. Then we address the question of which principle should be applied efficiently to combine these units. Improvements for Critic modeling and accuracy of Actor–Critic models for a natural task are finally discussed in the perspective of our Psikharpax project—an artificial rat having to survive autonomously in unpredictable environments.},

However, basic forms of these rules are effective under only a restricted set of conditions in which the environment is stable. Recent studies have defined optimal solutions to learning problems in more general, potentially unstable, environments, but the relevance of these complex mathematical solutions to how the brain solves these problems remains unclear. Here, we show that one such Bayesian solution can be approximated by a computationally straightforward mixture of simple error-driven 'Delta' rules. This simpler model can make effective inferences in a dynamic environment and matches human performance on a predictive-inference task using a mixture of a small number of Delta rules. This model represents an important conceptual advance in our understanding of how the brain can use relatively simple computations to make nearly optimal inferences in a dynamic world.},

The model explains why briefly flashed static dots are perceived to lag behind continuously visible moving dots, without the need for a motion extrapolation process [Nijhawan, R. (1994). Nature, 370, 256–257]. The dependence of this illusion on parameters such as the velocity, duration, frequency and number of flashes of the motion trajectories is accurately captured by the model. Furthermore, the model makes two predictions. First, briefly flashed dots on a staircase trajectory should lead dots with a long duration. Secondly, it should be possible to abolish the lag-effect between continuously visible and stroboscopically moving objects by halting the continuously visible dots during the interflash interval of the stroboscopic dots. Both predictions are corroborated in experiments.},

This thin, layered structure comprises distinct, functionally specialized areas that communicate with each other through the axons of pyramidal neurons. For the hundreds of such cortico-cortical pathways to underlie diverse functions, their cellular and synaptic architectures must differ so that they result in distinct computations at the target projection neurons. In what ways do these pathways differ? By originating and terminating in different laminae, and by selectively targeting specific populations of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, these ‘interareal' pathways can differentially control the timing and strength of synaptic inputs onto individual neurons, resulting in layer-specific computations. Due to the rapid development in transgenic techniques, the mouse has emerged as a powerful mammalian model for understanding the rules by which cortical circuits organize and function. Here we review our understanding of how cortical lamination constrains long-range communication in the mammalian brain, with an emphasis on the mouse visual cortical network. We discuss the laminar architecture underlying interareal communication, the role of neocortical layers in organizing the balance of excitatory and inhibitory actions, and highlight the structure and function of layer 1 in mouse visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Despite being a fundamental dimension of experience, how the human brain generates the perception of time remains unknown. Predominant models of human time perception propose the existence of oscillatory neural processes that continually track physical time - so called pacemakers - similar to the system clock of a computer. However, clear neural evidence for pacemakers at psychologically relevant timescales is lacking, raising the question of whether internal pacemakers are necessary for time perception. Here we show that clock-like pacemaker processes are not required for human time perception. We built an artificial neural system based on a feed-forward image classification network, functionally similar to human visual processing. In this system, input videos of natural scenes drive changes in activation within an image classification network and accumulation of salient changes in activations are used to estimate time. Estimates produced by this system match human reports made about the same videos, replicating key qualitative aspects such as report variability proportional to duration (scalar variability/Weber's law) and response regression to the mean (Vierordt's law). System-generated estimates also differentiate by scene type, such as walking around a busy city or sitting in a cafe, producing the same pattern of differences as human reports. Our results show how time perception can be derived from the operation of non-temporal perceptual classification processes, without any neural pacemaker, opening new opportunities for investigating the neural foundations of this central aspect of human experience.},

The {FFG} framework provides both an insightful representation of the probabilistic model and a biologically plausible inference scheme that, in principle, can be automatically executed in a computer simulation. As an illustrative example, we present an {FFG} for a deep temporal active inference process.

However, little is known about how orientation can be read out from the activity of neural populations, in particular in alert animals. Our study is a first step toward that goal. We recorded from up to 20 well isolated single neurons in the primary visual cortex of alert macaques simultaneously and applied a simple, neurally plausible decoder to read out the population code. We focus on two questions: First, what are the time course and the timescale at which orientation can be read out from the population response? Second, how complex does the decoding mechanism in a downstream neuron have to be to reliably discriminate between visual stimuli with different orientations? We show that the neural ensembles in primary visual cortex of awake macaques represent orientation in a way that facilitates a fast and simple readout mechanism: With an average latency of 30-80 ms, the population code can be read out instantaneously with a short integration time of only tens of milliseconds, and neither stimulus contrast nor correlations need to be taken into account to compute the optimal synaptic weight pattern. Our study shows that-similar to the case of single-neuron computation-the representation of orientation in the spike patterns of neural populations can serve as an exemplary case for understanding the computations performed by neural ensembles underlying visual processing during behavior.},

	abstract = {Multichannel electroencephalography ({EEG}) offers a non-invasive tool to explore spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity. With {EEG} recordings consisting of multiple trials, traditional signal processing approaches that ignore inter-trial variability in the data may fail to accurately estimate the underlying spatio-temporal brain patterns. Moreover, precise characterization of such inter-trial variability per se can be of high scientific value in establishing the relationship between brain activity and behavior. In this paper, a statistical modeling framework is introduced for learning spatio-temporal decompositions of multiple-trial {EEG} data recorded under two contrasting experimental conditions. By modeling the variance of source signals as random variables varying across trials, the proposed two-stage hierarchical Bayesian model is able to capture inter-trial amplitude variability in the data in a sparse way where a parsimonious representation of the data can be obtained. A variational Bayesian ({VB}) algorithm is developed for statistical inference of the hierarchical model. The efficacy of the proposed modeling framework is validated with the analysis of both synthetic and real {EEG} data. In the simulation study we show that even at low signal-to-noise ratios our approach is able to recover with high precision the underlying spatio-temporal patterns and the dynamics of source amplitude across trials; on two brain-computer interface ({BCI}) data sets we show that our {VB} algorithm can extract physiologically meaningful spatio-temporal patterns and make more accurate predictions than other two widely used algorithms: the common spatial patterns ({CSP}) algorithm and the Infomax algorithm for independent component analysis ({ICA}). The results demonstrate that our statistical modeling framework can serve as a powerful tool for extracting brain patterns, characterizing trial-to-trial brain dynamics, and decoding brain states by exploiting useful structures in the data.},

We show that each class of shifting neurons exists in two subtypes, with spatiotemporal activity profiles that suggest different roles for each subtype at the start and end of tethered-walking turns. Shifting neurons are required for the heading system to properly track the fly's heading in the dark, and stimulation of these neurons induces predictable shifts in the heading signal. The central features of this biological circuit are analogous to those of computational models proposed for head-direction cells in rodents and may shed light on how neural systems, in general, perform integration.},

Understanding how meaning could arise from a physical world has proven to be a tough problem. The basic scheme of Darwinian evolution produces adaptations that only represent apparent ('as if') goals and meaning. Here I use evolutionary models to show that a slight, evolvable extension of the basic scheme is sufficient to produce genuine goals. The extension, targeted modulation of mutation rate, is known to be generally present in biological cells, and gives rise to two phenomena that are absent from the non-living world: intrinsic meaning and the ability to initiate goal-directed chains of causation. The extended scheme accomplishes this by utilizing randomness modulated by a feedback loop that is itself regulated by evolutionary pressure. The mechanism can be extended to behavioural variability as well, and thus shows how freedom of behaviour is possible. A further extension to communication suggests that the active exchange of intrinsic meaning between organisms may be the origin of consciousness, which in combination with active causation can provide a physical basis for the phenomenon of free will.},

It focuses on the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behaviour and how they contextualise each other. We show that habits emerge naturally (and autodidactically) from sequential policy optimisation when agents are equipped with state-action policies. In active inference, behaviour has explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) aspects that are sensitive to ambiguity and risk respectively, where epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) behaviour enables pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviour and the subsequent emergence of habits. Although goal-directed and habitual policies are usually associated with model-based and model-free schemes, we find the more important distinction is between belief-free and belief-based schemes. The underlying (variational) belief updating provides a comprehensive (if metaphorical) process theory for several phenomena, including the transfer of dopamine responses, reversal learning, habit formation and devaluation. Finally, we show that active inference reduces to a classical (Bellman) scheme, in the absence of ambiguity.},

	abstract = {Novelty exploration can enhance hippocampal plasticity in animals through dopaminergic neuromodulation arising in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area ({SN}/{VTA}). This enhancement can outlast the exploration phase by several minutes. Currently, little is known about dopaminergic novelty processing and its relationship to hippocampal function in humans. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies, {SN}/{VTA} activations in humans were indeed driven by stimulus novelty rather than other forms of stimulus salience such as rareness, negative emotional valence, or targetness of familiar stimuli, whereas hippocampal responses were less selective. {SN}/{VTA} novelty responses were scaled according to absolute rather than relative novelty in a given context, unlike adaptive {SN}/{VTA} responses recently reported for reward outcome in animal studies. Finally, novelty enhanced learning and perirhinal/parahippocampal processing of familiar items presented in the same context. Thus, the human {SN}/{VTA} can code absolute stimulus novelty and might contribute to enhancing learning in the context of novelty. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments—active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning—and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences.},

The {TENN}-Lab group has developed a hardware/software co-design framework for this exploration, on which we perform research with three thrusts: (1) Devices for computing, such as memristors and biomimetic membranes. (2) Applications that employ spiking neural networks for processing. (3) Machine learning techniques to program. The design framework is unified, because it allows all three thrusts to work in concert, so that, for example, new results on device design can apply instantly to the current results of applications and learning. In this paper, we detail the interweaving components of the design framework. We then describe case studies on each of the research thrusts above, highlighting how the unified framework is enabling to each case study.},

	doi = {10.1101/272492},
	abstract = {Escaping from imminent danger is an instinctive behaviour fundamental for survival that requires classifying sensory stimuli as harmless or threatening. The absence of threat allows animals to forage for essential resources, but as the level of threat and potential for harm increases, they have to decide whether or not to seek safety. Despite previous work on instinctive defensive behaviours in rodents, little is known about how the brain computes the threat level for initiating escape. Here we show that the probability and vigour of escape in mice scale with the intensity of innate threats, and are well described by a theoretical model that computes the distance between threat level and an escape threshold. Calcium imaging and optogenetics in the midbrain of freely behaving mice show that the activity of excitatory {VGluT}2+ neurons in the deep layers of the medial superior colliculus ({mSC}) represents the threat stimulus intensity and is predictive of escape, whereas dorsal periaqueductal gray ({dPAG}) {VGluT}2+ neurons encode exclusively the escape choice and control escape vigour. We demonstrate a feed-forward monosynaptic excitatory connection from {mSC} to {dPAG} neurons that is weak and unreliable, yet necessary for escape behaviour, and which we suggest provides a synaptic threshold for {dPAG} activation and the initiation of escape. This threshold can be overcome by high {mSC} network activity because of short-term synaptic facilitation and recurrent excitation within the {mSC}, which amplifies and sustains synaptic drive to the {dPAG}. Thus, {dPAG} {VGluT}2+ neurons compute escape decisions and vigour using a synaptic mechanism to threshold threat information received from the {mSC}, and provide a biophysical model of how the brain performs a critical behavioural computation.},

	abstract = {Our visual environment is full of texture-"stuff" like cloth, bark, or gravel as distinct from "things" like dresses, trees, or paths-and humans are adept at perceiving subtle variations in material properties. To investigate image features important for texture perception, we psychophysically compare a recent parametric model of texture appearance (convolutional neural network [{CNN}] model) that uses the features encoded by a deep {CNN} ({VGG}-19) with two other models: the venerable Portilla and Simoncelli model and an extension of the {CNN} model in which the power spectrum is additionally matched. Observers discriminated model-generated textures from original natural textures in a spatial three-alternative oddity paradigm under two viewing conditions: when test patches were briefly presented to the near-periphery ("parafoveal") and when observers were able to make eye movements to all three patches ("inspection"). Under parafoveal viewing, observers were unable to discriminate 10 of 12 original images from {CNN} model images, and remarkably, the simpler Portilla and Simoncelli model performed slightly better than the {CNN} model (11 textures). Under foveal inspection, matching {CNN} features captured appearance substantially better than the Portilla and Simoncelli model (nine compared to four textures), and including the power spectrum improved appearance matching for two of the three remaining textures. None of the models we test here could produce indiscriminable images for one of the 12 textures under the inspection condition. While deep {CNN} ({VGG}-19) features can often be used to synthesize textures that humans cannot discriminate from natural textures, there is currently no uniformly best model for all textures and viewing conditions.},

	abstract = {We present a spiking neural network model of the thalamic Lateral Geniculate Nucleus ({LGN}) developed on {SpiNNaker}, which is a state-of-the-art digital neuromorphic hardware built with very-low-power {ARM} processors. The parallel, event-based data processing in {SpiNNaker} makes it viable for building massively parallel neuro-computational frameworks. The {LGN} model has 140 neurons representing a `basic building block' for larger modular architectures. The motivation of this work is to simulate biologically plausible {LGN} dynamics on {SpiNNaker}. Synaptic layout of the model is consistent with biology. The model response is validated with existing literature reporting entrainment in steady state visually evoked potentials ({SSVEP}) — brain oscillations corresponding to periodic visual stimuli recorded via electroencephalography ({EEG}). Periodic stimulus to the model is provided by: a synthetic spike-train with inter-spike-intervals in the range 10 – 50 Hz at a resolution of 1 Hz; and spike-train output from a state-of-the-art electronic retina subjected to a light emitting diode flashing at 10, 20 and 40 Hz, simulating real-world visual stimulus to the model. The resolution of simulation is 0.1 ms to ensure solution accuracy for the underlying differential equations defining Izhikevich's neuron model. Under this constraint, 1 s of model simulation time is executed in 10 s real time on {SpiNNaker}; this is because simulations on {SpiNNaker} work in real time for time-steps dt {\textgreater}= 1 ms. The model output shows entrainment with both sets of input and contains harmonic components of the fundamental frequency. However, suppressing the feed-forward inhibition in the circuit produces subharmonics within the gamma band ({\textgreater} 30 Hz) implying a reduced information transmission fidelity. These model predictions agree with recent lumped-parameter computational model-based predictions, using conventional computers. Scalability of the framework is demonstrated by a multi-node architecture consisting of three `nodes', where each node is the `basic building block' {LGN} model. This 420 neuron model is tested with synthetic periodic stimulus at 10 Hz to all the nodes. The model output is the average of the outputs from all nodes, and conforms to the above-mentioned predictions of each node. Power consumption for model simulation on {SpiNNaker} is {\textless}{\textless} 1 W.},

The fundamental hypothesis behind this work is that the mammalian retina generates an efficient neural code associated to the visual flux. The main novelty of this work is to show how this neural code can be exploited in the context of still image compression. Our model has three main stages. The first stage is the bio-inspired retina model proposed by Thorpe et al, which transforms an image into a wave of spikes. This transform is based on the so-called rank order coding. In the second stage, we show how this wave of spikes can be expressed using a 4-ary dictionary alphabet, through a stack run coder. The third stage consists of applying a first order arithmetic coder to the stack run coded signal. We compare our results to {JPEG} standards and we show that our model has comparable performance for lower computational cost under strong bit rate restrictions when data is highly contaminated with noise. In addition, our model offers scalability for monitoring data transmission flow. The subject matter presented highlights a variety of important issues in the conception of novel bio-inspired compression schemes and additionally presents many potential avenues for future research efforts.},

	abstract = {We introduce a mathematical model of embodied consciousness, the Projective Consciousness Model ({PCM}), which is based on the hypothesis that the spatial field of consciousness ({FoC}) is structured by a projective geometry and under the control of a process of active inference. The {FoC} in the {PCM} combines multisensory evidence with prior beliefs in memory and frames them by selecting points of view and perspectives according to preferences. The choice of projective frames governs how expectations are transformed by consciousness. Violations of expectation are encoded as free energy. Free energy minimization drives perspective taking, and controls the switch between perception, imagination and action. In the {PCM}, consciousness functions as an algorithm for the maximization of resilience, using projective perspective taking and imagination in order to escape local minima of free energy. The {PCM} can account for a variety of psychological phenomena: the characteristic spatial phenomenology of subjective experience, the distinctions and integral relationships between perception, imagination and action, the role of affective processes in intentionality, but also perceptual phenomena such as the dynamics of bistable figures and body swap illusions in virtual reality. It relates phenomenology to function, showing the computational advantages of consciousness. It suggests that changes of brain states from unconscious to conscious reflect the action of projective transformations and suggests specific neurophenomenological hypotheses about the brain, guidelines for designing artificial systems, and formal principles for psychology.},

However, this complexity can be greatly reduced when constraints of time and space are taken into account. The brain is constrained by the body to limit its goal-directed behaviors to just a few independent tasks over the scale of 1-2 min, and can pursue only a very small number of independent agendas. These limitations have been characterized from a number of different vantage points such as attention, working memory and dual task performance. It may be possible that the disparate perspectives of all these methodologies can be unified if behaviors can be seen as modular and hierarchically organized. From this vantage point, cognition can be seen as having a central problem of scheduling behaviors to achieve short-term goals. Thus dual-task paradigms can be seen as studying the concurrent management of simultaneous, competing agendas. Attention can be seen as focusing on the decision as to whether to interrupt the current agenda or persevere. Working memory can be seen as the bookkeeping necessary to manage the state of the current active agenda items.},

We investigate the effects that input noise, occlusion, and the {VC}-dimensions of the related representation classes have in terms of localizing all objects present in the search region, under finite computational resources and a search cost constraint. We present a number of bounds relating the noise-rate of low level feature detection to the {VC}-dimension of an object representable by an architecture satisfying the given computational constraints. We prove that under certain conditions, the corresponding classes of object localization and recognition problems are efficiently learnable in the presence of noise and under a purposive learning strategy, as there exists a polynomial upper bound on the minimum number of examples necessary to correctly localize the targets under the given models of uncertainty. We also use these arguments to show that passive approaches to the same problem do not necessarily guarantee that the problem is efficiently learnable. Under this formulation, we prove the existence of a number of emergent relations between the object detection noise-rate, the scene representation length, the object class complexity, and the representation class complexity, which demonstrate that selective attention is not only necessary due to computational complexity constraints, but it is also necessary as a noise-suppression mechanism and as a mechanism for efficient object class learning. These results concretely demonstrate the advantages of active, purposive and attentive approaches for solving complex vision problems.},

	abstract = {Perception involves two types of decisions about the sensory world: identification of stimulus features as analog quantities, or discrimination of the same stimulus features among a set of discrete alternatives. Veridical judgment and categorical discrimination have traditionally been conceptualized as two distinct computational problems. Here, we found that these two types of decision making can be subserved by a shared cortical circuit mechanism. We used a continuous recurrent network model to simulate two monkey experiments in which subjects were required to make either a two-alternative forced choice or a veridical judgment about the direction of random-dot motion. The model network is endowed with a continuum of bell-shaped population activity patterns, each representing a possible motion direction. Slow recurrent excitation underlies accumulation of sensory evidence, and its interplay with strong recurrent inhibition leads to decision behaviors. The model reproduced the monkey's performance as well as single-neuron activity in the categorical discrimination task. Furthermore, we examined how direction identification is determined by a combination of sensory stimulation and microstimulation. Using a population-vector measure, we found that direction judgments instantiate winner-take-all (with the population vector coinciding with either the coherent motion direction or the electrically elicited motion direction) when two stimuli are far apart, or vector averaging (with the population vector falling between the two directions) when two stimuli are close to each other. Interestingly, for a broad range of intermediate angular distances between the two stimuli, the network displays a mixed strategy in the sense that direction estimates are stochastically produced by winner-take-all on some trials and by vector averaging on the other trials, a model prediction that is experimentally testable. This work thus lends support to a common neurodynamic framework for both veridical judgment and categorical discrimination in perceptual decision making.},

These many behaviors could rely on distinct categories of neurons specialized to represent particular variables or could rely on a single population of {PPC} neurons that is leveraged in different ways. To distinguish these possibilities, we evaluated rat {PPC} neurons recorded during multisensory decisions. Newly designed tests revealed that task parameters and temporal response features were distributed randomly across neurons, without evidence of categories. This suggests that {PPC} neurons constitute a dynamic network that is decoded according to the animal's present needs. To test for an additional signature of a dynamic network, we compared moments when behavioral demands differed: decision and movement. Our new state-space analysis revealed that the network explored different dimensions during decision and movement. These observations suggest that a single network of neurons can support the evolving behavioral demands of decision-making.},

Here we study the function of top-down input in the mouse superior colliculus ({SC}), which receives convergent inputs from the retina and visual cortex. Neurons in the superficial {SC} display robust responses and speed tuning to looming stimuli that mimic approaching objects. The looming-evoked responses are reduced by almost half when the visual cortex is optogenetically silenced in awake, but not in anesthetized, mice. Silencing the cortex does not change the looming speed tuning of {SC} neurons, or the response time course, except at the lowest tested speed. Furthermore, the regulation of {SC} responses by the corticotectal input is organized retinotopically. This effect we revealed may thus provide a potential substrate for the cortex, an evolutionarily new structure, to modulate {SC}-mediated visual behaviors.},

While these architectures are useful for exploring the computational properties of large-scale models of the nervous system, the challenge of building low-power compact physical artifacts that can behave intelligently in the real-world and exhibit cognitive abilities still remains open. In this paper we propose a set of neuromorphic engineering solutions to address this challenge. In particular, we review neuromorphic circuits for emulating neural and synaptic dynamics in real-time and discuss the role of biophysically realistic temporal dynamics in hardware neural processing architectures; we review the challenges of realizing spike-based plasticity mechanisms in real physical systems and present examples of analog electronic circuits that implement them; we describe the computational properties of recurrent neural networks and show how neuromorphic Winner-Take-All circuits can implement working-memory and decision-making mechanisms. We validate the neuromorphic approach proposed with experimental results obtained from our own circuits and systems, and argue how the circuits and networks presented in this work represent a useful set of components for efficiently and elegantly implementing neuromorphic cognition.},

Recent probabilistic frameworks that cast perception as unconscious inference on the external causes of sensory input can thus be expanded to enfold the brain's representation of others' mental states. This paper examines this subject in the context of the debate concerning the extent to which we have perceptual awareness of other minds. In particular, we suggest that the notion of perceptual presence helps to refine this debate: are others' mental states experienced as veridical qualities of the perceptual world around us? This experiential aspect of social cognition may be central to conditions such as autism spectrum disorder, where representations of others' mental states seem to be selectively compromised. Importantly, recent work ties perceptual presence to the counterfactual predictions of hierarchical generative models that are suggested to perform unconscious inference in the brain. This enables a characterisation of mental state representations in terms of their associated counterfactual predictions, allowing a distinction between spontaneous and explicit forms of mentalising within the framework of predictive processing. This leads to a hypothesis that social cognition in autism spectrum disorder is characterised by a diminished set of counterfactual predictions and the reduced perceptual presence of others' mental states.},

To address functional issues such as the {ON}/{OFF} structure of visual cortical receptive fields with modelling studies, a geniculate cell model is needed where the spatial and temporal characteristics of the visual response are described quantitatively. We propose a model simulating the spike trains produced by cat geniculate nonlagged X-cells, based on a review of the electrophysiological literature. The level of description chosen is phenomenological, fitting the dynamics and amplitude of phasic and tonic responses, center/surround antagonism, surround excitatory responses, and the statistical properties of both spontaneous and visually evoked spike trains. The model, which has been constrained so as to reproduce the responses to centered light spots of expanding size and optimal light and dark annuli, predicts responses to thin and large bars flashed in various positions of the receptive field. The switching gamma renewal process method has been introduced for modelling spontaneous and visually evoked spike trains within the same mathematical framework. The statistical structure of the spike process is assumed to be more regular during phasic than tonic visual responses. On the whole, this model generates more realistic geniculate input to cortex than the currently used retinal models.},

Detrimental effects of noise are converted into a principled way of controlling movements. Attractive aspects of such theories are their ability to explain not only characteristic features of single motor acts, but also statistical properties of repeated actions. Here, we present a critical analysis of stochastic optimality in motor control which reveals several difficulties with this hypothesis. We show that stochastic control may not be necessary to explain the stochastic nature of motor behavior, and we propose an alternative framework, based on the action of a deterministic controller coupled with an optimal state estimator, which relieves drawbacks of stochastic optimality and appropriately explains movement variability.},

Negative images had lower apparent contrast than their positives. Contrast detection thresholds showed spatial-frequency-dependent el- evation following both notch filtering and phase randomization. The peak of the spatial-frequency tuning function was approximately 0.5–2 cycles per degree (c/deg). Suprathreshold contrast matching functions also showed spatial-frequency-dependent contrast loss for both notch-filtered and phase-randomized images. The peak of the spatial-frequency tuning function was approximately 1–3 c/deg. There was no detectable differ- ence between the effects of phase randomization and notch filtering on contrast sensitivity.

	abstract = {The anterior inferotemporal cortex ({IT}) is the highest stage along the hierarchy of visual areas that, in primates, processes visual objects. Although several lines of evidence suggest that {IT} primarily represents visual shape information, some recent studies have argued that neuronal ensembles in {IT} code the semantic membership of visual objects (i.e., represent conceptual classes such as animate and inanimate objects). In this study, we investigated to what extent semantic, rather than purely visual information, is represented in {IT} by performing a multivariate analysis of {IT} responses to a set of visual objects. By relying on a variety of machine-learning approaches (including a cutting-edge clustering algorithm that has been recently developed in the domain of statistical physics), we found that, in most instances, {IT} representation of visual objects is accounted for by their similarity at the level of shape or, more surprisingly, low-level visual properties. Only in a few cases we observed {IT} representations of semantic classes that were not explainable by the visual similarity of their members. Overall, these findings reassert the primary function of {IT} as a conveyor of explicit visual shape information, and reveal that low-level visual properties are represented in {IT} to a greater extent than previously appreciated. In addition, our work demonstrates how combining a variety of state-of-the-art multivariate approaches, and carefully estimating the contribution of shape similarity to the representation of object categories, can substantially advance our understanding of neuronal coding of visual objects in cortex.},

	abstract = {Single neurons in areas V1 and V2 of macaque visual cortex respond selectively to luminance-modulated stimuli. These responses are often influenced by context, for example when stimuli extend outside the classical receptive field ({CRF}). These contextual phenomena, observed in many sensory areas, reflect a fundamental cortical computation and may inform perception by signaling second-order visual features which are defined by spatial relationships of contrast, orientation and spatial frequency. In the anesthe- tized, paralyzed macaque, we measured single-unit responses to a drifting preferred sinusoidal grating; low spatial frequency sinusoidal contrast modulations were applied to the grating, creating contrast- modulated, second-order forms. Most neurons responded selectively to the orientation of the contrast modulation of the preferred grating and were therefore second-order orientation-selective. Second-order selectivity was created by the asymmetric spatial organization of the excitatory {CRF} and suppressive extraclassical surround. We modeled these receptive field subregions using spatial Gaussians, sensitive to the modulation of contrast (not luminance) of the preferred carrier grating, that summed linearly and were capable of recovering asymmetrical receptive field organizations. Our modeling suggests that second-order selectivity arises both from elongated excitatory {CRFs}, asymmetrically organized extraclas- sical surround suppression, or both.Wevalidated the model by successfully testing its predictions against conventional surround suppression measurements and spike-triggered analysis of second-order form responses. Psychophysical adaptation measurements on human observers revealed a pattern of sec- ond-order form selectivity consistent with neural response patterns. We therefore propose that cortical cells in primates do double duty, providing signals about both first- and second-order forms. ?},

This study investigated whether patients with schizophrenia simply show restricted free visual exploration behavior reflected by reduced saccade frequency and increased fixation duration or whether patients use qualitatively different exploration strategies than healthy controls. Methods: Scanpaths of 32 patients with schizophrenia and age-matched 33 healthy controls were assessed while participants freely explored six photos of daily life situations (20 s/photo) evaluated for cognitive complexity and emotional strain. Using fixation and saccade parameters, we compared temporal changes in exploration behavior, cluster analyses, attentional landscapes, and analyses of scanpath similarities between both groups. Results: We found fewer fixation clusters, longer fixation durations within a cluster, fewer changes between clusters, and a greater increase of fixation duration over time in patients compared to controls. Scanpath patterns and attentional landscapes in patients also differed significantly from those of controls. Generally, cognitive complexity and emotional strain had significant effects on visual exploration behavior. This effect was similar in both groups as were physical properties of fixation locations. Conclusions: Longer attention allocation to a given feature in a scene and less attention shifts in patients suggest a more focal processing mode compared to a more ambient exploration strategy in controls. These visual exploration alterations were present in patients independently of cognitive complexity, emotional strain or physical properties of visual cues implying that they represent a rather general deficit. Despite this impairment, patients were able to adapt their scanning behavior to changes in cognitive complexity and emotional strain similar to controls.},

	abstract = {Human perception has recently been characterized as statistical inference based on noisy and ambiguous sensory inputs. Moreover, suitable neural representations of uncertainty have been identified that could underlie such probabilistic computations. In this review, we argue that learning an internal model of the sensory environment is another key aspect of the same statistical inference procedure and thus perception and learning need to be treated jointly. We review evidence for statistically optimal learning in humans and animals, and re-evaluate possible neural representations of uncertainty based on their potential to support statistically optimal learning. We propose that spontaneous activity can have a functional role in such representations leading to a new, sampling-based, framework of how the cortex represents information and uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Spatial context in images induces perceptual phenomena associated with salience and modulates the responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the computational and ecological principles underlying contextual effects are incompletely understood. We introduce a model of natural images that includes grouping and segmentation of neighboring features based on their joint statistics, and we interpret the firing rates of V1 neurons as performing optimal recognition in this model. We show that this leads to a substantial generalization of divisive normalization, a computation that is ubiquitous in many neural areas and systems. A main novelty in our model is that the influence of the context on a target stimulus is determined by their degree of statistical dependence. We optimized the parameters of the model on natural image patches, and then simulated neural and perceptual responses on stimuli used in classical experiments. The model reproduces some rich and complex response patterns observed in V1, such as the contrast dependence, orientation tuning and spatial asymmetry of surround suppression, while also allowing for surround facilitation under conditions of weak stimulation. It also mimics the perceptual salience produced by simple displays, and leads to readily testable predictions. Our results provide a principled account of orientation-based contextual modulation in early vision and its sensitivity to the homogeneity and spatial arrangement of inputs, and lends statistical support to the theory that V1 computes visual salience.},

Although many similarities between spontaneous and sensory-evoked neocortical activity have been reported, little is known about consistent differences between them. Here, using simultaneously recorded cortical populations and morphologically identified pyramidal cells, we compare the laminar structure of spontaneous and sensory-evoked population activity in rat auditory cortex. Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively.},

Consistent with this role, neurons in V4 are selective for many visual attributes including color, orientation, and binocular disparity. However, it is uncertain whether cells within V4 are organized with respect to these properties. In this study we used in vivo optical imaging and electrophysiology in macaque visual cortex to show that cells that share certain physiological properties are indeed grouped together in V4. Our results revealed regions containing cells with common orientation selectivity. These regions were similar in size to those seen in V2 and much larger than those seen in V1 and were confirmed by appropriately targeted single-unit recording. Surprisingly, orientation organization visible through imaging was limited to the portion of V4 representing the central visual fields. Optical imaging also revealed a functional organization related to stimulus size. Size-sensitive regions (S regions) contained cells that were strongly suppressed by large stimuli. In contrast to V2, S regions in V4 contain orientation domains. These results suggest that V4 contains modular assemblies of cells related to particular aspects of form analysis. Such organization may contribute to the construction of object-based representations.},

	abstract = {The discovery of stimulus induced synchronisation in the visual cortex suggested the possibility that the relations among low-level stimulus features are encoded by the temporal relationship between neuronal discharges. In this framework, temporal coherence is considered a signature of perceptual grouping. This insight triggered a large number of experimental studies which sought to investigate the relationship between temporal coordination and cognitive functions. While some core predictions derived from the initial hypothesis were confirmed, these studies, also revealed a rich dynamical landscape beyond simple coherence whose role in signal processing is still poorly understood. In this paper a framework is presented which establishes links between the various manifestations of cortical dynamics by assigning specific coding functions to low dimensional dynamic features such as synchronized oscillations and phase shifts on the one hand and high dimensional non-linear, non-stationary dynamics on the other. The data serving as basis for this synthetic approach have been obtained with chronic multisite recordings from the visual cortex of anesthetized cats and from monkeys trained to solve cognitive tasks. It is proposed that the low dimensional dynamics characterized by synchronized oscillations and large-scale correlations are sub-states that represent the results of computations performed in the high dimensional state space provided by recurrently coupled networks.},

	abstract = {Sensory-motor behavior results from a complex interaction of noisy sensory data with priors based on recent experience. By varying the stimulus form and contrast for the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements in monkeys, we show that visual motion inputs compete with two independent priors: one prior biases eye speed toward zero; the other prior attracts eye direction according to the past several days' history of target directions. The priors bias the speed and direction of the initiation of pursuit for the weak sensory data provided by the motion of a low-contrast sine wave grating. However, the priors have relatively little effect on pursuit speed and direction when the visual stimulus arises from the coherent motion of a high-contrast patch of dots. For any given stimulus form, the mean and variance of eye speed covary in the initiation of pursuit, as expected for signal-dependent noise. This relationship suggests that pursuit implements a trade-off between movement accuracy and variation, reducing both when the sensory signals are noisy. The tradeoff is implemented as a competition of sensory data and priors that follows the rules of Bayesian estimation. Computer simulations show that the priors can be understood as direction-specific control of the strength of visual-motor transmission, and can be implemented in a neural-network model that makes testable predictions about the population response in the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields.},

	abstract = {Recent experimental work has demonstrated the existence of extremely rapid saccades toward faces in natural scenes that can be initiated only 100 ms after image onset (Crouzet et al., 2010). These ultra-rapid saccades constitute a major challenge to current models of processing in the visual system because they do not seem to leave enough time for even a single feed-forward pass through the ventral stream. Here we explore the possibility that the information required to trigger these very fast saccades could be extracted very early on in visual processing using relatively low-level amplitude spectrum ({AS}) information in the Fourier domain. Experiment 1 showed that {AS} normalization can significantly alter face-detection performance. However, a decrease of performance following {AS} normalization does not alone prove that {AS}-based information is used (Gaspar and Rousselet, 2009). In Experiment 2, following the Gaspar and Rousselet paper, we used a swapping procedure to clarify the role of {AS} information in fast object detection. Our experiment is composed of three conditions: (i) original images, (ii) category swapped, in which the face image has the {AS} of a vehicle, and the vehicle has the {AS} of a face, and (iii) identity swapped, where the face has the {AS} of another face image, and the vehicle has the {AS} of another vehicle image. The results showed very similar levels of performance in the original and identity swapped conditions, and a clear drop in the category swapped condition. This result demonstrates that, in the early temporal window offered by the saccadic choice task, the visual saccadic system does indeed rely on low-level {AS} information in order to rapidly detect faces. This sort of crude diagnostic information could potentially be derived very early on in the visual system, possibly as early as V1 and V2.},

	abstract = {Autonomous guidance of Micro-Air Vehicles ({MAVs}) in unknown environments is a challenging task because these artificial creatures have small aeromechanical time constants, which make them prone to be disturbed by gusts of wind. Flying insects are subject to quite similar kinds of disturbances, yet they navigate swiftly and deftly. Flying insects display highperformance visuo-motor control systems that have stood the test of time. They can therefore teach us how vision can be used for immediate and vital actions. We built a 50-gram tethered aerial demonstrator, called {OSCAR} {II}, which manages to keep its gaze steadily fixating a target (a dark edge), in spite of nasty thumps that we deliberately gave to its body with a custom-made "slapping machine". The robot's agile yaw reactions are based on: - a mechanical decoupling of the eye from the body - an active coupling of the robot's heading with its gaze - a Visual Fixation Reflex ({VFR}) - a Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex ({VOR}) - an accurate and fast actuator (Voice Coil Motor, {VCM}) The actuator is a 2.4-gram voice coil motor that is able to rotate the eye with a rise time as small as 12ms, that is, much shorter than the rise time of human oculo-motor saccades. In connection with a micro-rate gyro, this actuator endows the robot with a high performance "vestibulo ocular reflex" that keeps the gaze locked onto the target whatever perturbations in yaw affect the robot's body. Whenever the robot is destabilized (e.g., by a slap applied on one side), the gaze keeps fixating the target, while being the reference to which the robot's heading is servoed. It then takes the robot only 0:6s to realign its heading with its gaze.},

	abstract = {A key hypothesis in sensory system neuroscience is that sensory representations are adapted to the statistical regularities in sensory signals and thereby incorporate knowledge about the outside world. Supporting this hypothesis, several probabilistic models of local natural image regularities have been proposed that reproduce neural response properties. Although many such physiological links have been made, these models have not been linked directly to visual sensitivity. Previous psychophysical studies of sensitivity to natural image regularities focus on global perception of large images, but much less is known about sensitivity to local natural image regularities. We present a new paradigm for controlled psychophysical studies of local natural image regularities and compare how well such models capture perceptually relevant image content. To produce stimuli with precise statistics, we start with a set of patches cut from natural images and alter their content to generate a matched set whose joint statistics are equally likely under a probabilistic natural image model. The task is forced choice to discriminate natural patches from model patches. The results show that human observers can learn to discriminate the higher-order regularities in natural images from those of model samples after very few exposures and that no current model is perfect for patches as small as 5 by 5 pixels or larger. Discrimination performance was accurately predicted by model likelihood, an information theoretic measure of model efficacy, indicating that the visual system possesses a surprisingly detailed knowledge of natural image higher-order correlations, much more so than current image models. We also perform three cue identification experiments to interpret how model features correspond to perceptually relevant image features. Several aspects of primate visual physiology have been identified as adaptations to local regularities of natural images. However, much less work has measured visual sensitivity to local natural image regularities. Most previous work focuses on global perception of large images and shows that observers are more sensitive to visual information when image properties resemble those of natural images. In this work we measure human sensitivity to local natural image regularities using stimuli generated by patch-based probabilistic natural image models that have been related to primate visual physiology. We find that human observers can learn to discriminate the statistical regularities of natural image patches from those represented by current natural image models after very few exposures and that discriminability depends on the degree of regularities captured by the model. The quick learning we observed suggests that the human visual system is biased for processing natural images, even at very fine spatial scales, and that it has a surprisingly large knowledge of the regularities in natural images, at least in comparison to the state-of-the-art statistical models of natural images.},

By viewing curve organization as a statistical estimation problem, we suggest that it can. In particular, the classical Gestalt perceptual organization cues of proximity and good continuation—the basis of many current curve organization systems—can be statistically measured in images. As a prior for our estimation approach we introduce the curve indicator random field. In contrast to other techniques that require contour closure or are based on a sparse set of detected edges, the curve indicator random field emphasizes the short-distance, dense nature of organizing curve elements into (possibly) open curves. Its explicit formulation allows the calculation of its properties such as its autocorrelation. On the one hand, the curve indicator random field leads us to introduce the oriented Wiener filter, capturing the blur and noise inherent in the edge measurement process. On the other, it suggests we seek such correlations in natural images. We present the results of some initial edge correlation measurements that not only confirm the presence of Gestalt cues, but also suggest that curvature has a role in curve organization.},

We analyzed the mean-variance functions for single neurons, as well as signal and noise correlations between pairs of neurons. All three statistics showed a strong dependence on the bin width chosen for analysis. Changes in the correlation structure of single neuron spike trains over different bin sizes affected the mean-variance function, and signal and noise correlations between pairs of neurons were much smaller at small bin widths, increasing monotonically with the width of the bin. Analyses in the frequency domain showed that the noise between pairs of neurons, on average, was most strongly correlated at low frequencies, which explained the increase in noise correlation with increasing bin width. The coding performance was analyzed to determine whether the temporal precision of spike arrival times and the interactions within and between neurons could improve the prediction of the upcoming movement. We found that in approximately 62\% of neuron pairs, the arrival times of spikes at a resolution between 66 and 40 msec carried more information than spike counts in a 200 msec bin. In addition, in 19\% of neuron pairs, inclusion of within (11\%)- or between-neuron (8\%) correlations in spike trains improved decoding accuracy. These results suggest that in some {SMA} neurons elements of the spatiotemporal pattern of activity may be relevant for neural coding.},

Spatial and temporal phase differences between light and dark space-time maps clearly distinguished simple and complex cell populations. Complex cells usually showed similar direction preferences to light and dark bars, but many of the directional simple cells were much more direction selective to one sign of contrast than the reverse. We show that this is predicted by a simple energy model. Some of the direction-selective simple cells showed multiple space-time-slanted subregions, but others (previously described as S1 cells) had space-time maps that looked like just one subregion of an ordinary simple cell. Both simple and complex cells showed directional interactions (nonlinearities) to pairs of flashed bars (a 2-bar apparent-motion stimulus). The space-time slant of the simple cells correlated with the optimum {dX}/{dT} (velocity) of the paired-bar interactions. Some complex cells also showed a space-time slant; the direction of the slant usually correlated with the preferred direction of motion, but the degree of slant correlated with the inferred velocity tuning only when measured by a weighted-centroid calculation. Principal components analysis of the simple-cell space-time maps yielded one fast temporally biphasic component and a slower temporally monophasic component. We saw no consistent pattern for the spatial phase of the components, unlike previous reports; however, we show that principal components analysis may not distinguish between spatial offsets and phase offsets.},

The relative timing of presynaptic and postsynaptic spikes influences synaptic weights via an asymmetric learning window. A differential equation for the learning dynamics is derived under the assumption that the time scales of learning and neuronal spike dynamics can be separated. The differential equation is solved for a Poissonian neuron model with stochastic spike arrival. It is shown that correlations between input and output spikes tend to stabilize structure formation. With an appropriate choice of parameters, learning leads to an intrinsic normalization of the average weight and the output firing rate.

Further, we show that the full five-dimensional master equation for a conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron with spike-frequency adaptation and a relative refractory mechanism driven by Poisson spike trains can be reduced to a two-dimensional generalization of the proposed Markov process by an adiabatic elimination of fast variables. For static and dynamic stimulation, negative serial interspike interval correlations and transient population responses, respectively, of Monte Carlo simulations of the full five-dimensional system can be accurately described by the proposed two-dimensional Markov process.},

	abstract = {Visual recognition takes a small fraction of a second and relies on the cascade of signals along the ventral visual stream. Given the rapid path through multiple processing steps between photoreceptors and higher visual areas, information must progress from stage to stage very quickly. This rapid progression of information suggests that fine temporal details of the neural response may be important to the brain's encoding of visual signals. We investigated how changes in the relative timing of incoming visual stimulation affect the representation of object information by recording intracranial field potentials along the human ventral visual stream while subjects recognized objects whose parts were presented with varying asynchrony. Visual responses along the ventral stream were sensitive to timing differences as small as 17 ms between parts. In particular, there was a strong dependency on the temporal order of stimulus presentation, even at short asynchronies. From these observations we infer that the neural representation of complex information in visual cortex can be modulated by rapid dynamics on scales of tens of milliseconds.

Whereas much effort has been put in developing fast optimization techniques when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a hierarchy, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we present two different strategies: On the one hand, we show that the proximal operator associated with a sum of l\_infinity-norms can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a quadratic min-cost flow problem, allowing the use of accelerated proximal gradient methods. On the other hand, we use proximal splitting techniques, and address an equivalent formulation with non-overlapping groups, but in higher dimension and with additional constraints. We propose efficient and scalable algorithms exploiting these two strategies, which are significantly faster than alternative approaches. We illustrate these methods with several problems such as {CUR} matrix factorization, multi-task learning of tree-structured dictionaries, background subtraction in video sequences, image denoising with wavelets, and topographic dictionary learning of natural image patches.},

	abstract = {Rapid eyelid closure, or a blink, often accompanies head-restrained and head-unrestrained gaze shifts. This study examines the interactions between such gaze-evoked blinks and gaze shifts in monkeys. Blink probability increases with gaze amplitude and at a faster rate for head-unrestrained movements. Across animals, blink likelihood is inversely correlated with the average gaze velocity of large-amplitude control movements. Gaze-evoked blinks induce robust perturbations in eye velocity. Peak and average velocities are reduced, duration is increased, but accuracy is preserved. The temporal features of the perturbation depend on factors such as the time of blink relative to gaze onset, inherent velocity kinematics of control movements, and perhaps initial eye-in-head position. Although variable across animals, the initial effect is a reduction in eye velocity, followed by a reacceleration that yields two or more peaks in its waveform. Interestingly, head velocity is not attenuated; instead, it peaks slightly later and with a larger magnitude. Gaze latency is slightly reduced on trials with gaze-evoked blinks, although the effect was more variable during head-unrestrained movements; no reduction in head latency is observed. Preliminary data also demonstrate a similar perturbation of gaze-evoked blinks during vertical saccades. The results are compared with previously reported effects of reflexive blinks (evoked by air-puff delivered to one eye or supraorbital nerve stimulation) and discussed in terms of effects of blinks on saccadic suppression, neural correlates of the altered eye velocity signals, and implications on the hypothesis that the attenuation in eye velocity is produced by a head movement command.},

	abstract = {A key feature of neural networks is their ability to rapidly adjust their function, including signal gain and temporal dynamics, in response to changes in sensory inputs. These adjustments are thought to be important for optimizing the sensitivity of the system, yet their mechanisms remain poorly understood. We studied adaptive changes in temporal integration in direction-selective cells in macaque primary visual cortex, where specific hypotheses have been proposed to account for rapid adaptation. By independently stimulating direction-specific channels, we found that the control of temporal integration of motion at one direction was independent of motion signals driven at the orthogonal direction. We also found that individual neurons can simultaneously support two different profiles of temporal integration for motion in orthogonal directions. These findings rule out a broad range of adaptive mechanisms as being key to the control of temporal integration, including untuned normalization and nonlinearities of spike generation and somatic adaptation in the recorded direction-selective cells. Such mechanisms are too broadly tuned, or occur too far downstream, to explain the channel-specific and multiplexed temporal integration that we observe in single neurons. Instead, we are compelled to conclude that parallel processing pathways are involved, and we demonstrate one such circuit using a computer model. This solution allows processing in different direction/orientation channels to be separately optimized and is sensible given that, under typical motion conditions (e.g., translation or looming), speed on the retina is a function of the orientation of image components. Many neurons in visual cortex are understood in terms of their spatial and temporal receptive fields. It is now known that the spatiotemporal integration underlying visual responses is not fixed but depends on the visual input. For example, neurons that respond selectively to motion direction integrate signals over a shorter time window when visual motion is fast and a longer window when motion is slow. We investigated the mechanisms underlying this useful adaptation by recording from neurons as they responded to stimuli moving in two different directions at different speeds. Computer simulations of our results enabled us to rule out several candidate theories in favor of a model that integrates across multiple parallel channels that operate at different time scales.

	abstract = {In the mammalian cerebral cortex, neural responses are highly variable during spontaneous activity and sensory stimulation. To explain this variability, the cortex of alert animals has been proposed to be in an asynchronous high-conductance state in which irregular spiking arises from the convergence of large numbers of uncorrelated excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto individual neurons. Signatures of this state are that a neuron\&\#25;s membrane potential (Vm) hovers just below spike threshold, and its aggregate synaptic input is nearly Gaussian, arising from many uncorrelated inputs. Alternatively, irregular spiking could arise from infrequent correlated input events that elicit large fluctuations in Vm (refs 5, 6). To distinguish between these hypotheses, we developed a technique to perform whole-cell Vm measurements from the cortex of behaving monkeys, focusing on primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing a visual fixation task. Here we show that, contrary to the predictions of an asynchronous state, mean Vm during fixation was far from threshold (14\&\#9;{mV}) and spiking was triggered by occasional large spontaneous fluctuations. Distributions of Vm values were skewed beyond that expected for a range of Gaussian input, but were consistent with synaptic input arising from infrequent correlated events. Furthermore, spontaneous fluctuations in Vm were correlated with the surrounding network activity, as reflected in simultaneously recorded nearby local field potential. Visual stimulation, however, led to responses more consistent with an asynchronous state: mean Vm approached threshold, fluctuations became more Gaussian, and correlations between single neurons and the surrounding network were disrupted. These observations show that sensory drive can shift a common cortical circuitry from a synchronous to an asynchronous state.},

	abstract = {{SummaryAttention} typically amplifies neuronal responses evoked by task-relevant stimuli while attenuating responses to task-irrelevant distracters. In this context, visual distracters constitute an external source of noise that is diminished to improve attended signal quality. Activity that is internal to the cortex itself, stimulus-independent ongoing correlated fluctuations in firing, might also act as task-irrelevant noise. To examine this, we recorded from area V4 of macaques performing an attention-demanding task. The firing of neurons to identically repeated stimuli was highly variable. Much of this variability originates from ongoing low-frequency ({\textless}5 Hz) fluctuations in rate correlated across the neuronal population. When attention is directed to a stimulus inside a neuron's receptive field, these correlated fluctuations in rate are reduced. This attention-dependent reduction of ongoing cortical activity improves the signal-to-noise ratio of pooled neural signals substantially more than attention-dependent increases in firing rate. {IntroductionAttention} has long been known to improve our ability to detect and discriminate the features of sensory stimuli (James, 1890). One factor that contributes to this improvement in sensory processing is an attention-dependent increase in the mean firing rates of neurons driven by an attended stimulus and associated reductions in the firing rates of neurons driven by task-irrelevant stimuli (for recent reviews, see [Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004] and [Knudsen, 2007]). In addition to mean firing rate, a key factor determining the fidelity of neural signals is response variability. Even under the most controlled stimulus conditions, identically repeated sensory stimuli evoke neural responses that vary from trial to trial ([Softky and Koch, 1993] and [Shadlen and Newsome, 1998]). Response variability affects how reliably information is encoded by neuronal signals ([Parker and Newsome, 1998], [Zohary et al., 1994], [Shadlen et al., 1996], [Averbeck et al., 2006] and [Pillow et al., 2008]). An attention-dependent reduction in response variability could, therefore, significantly enhance sensory processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. Consistent with this, the variability of individual neurons is strongly reduced when spatial attention is directed toward the stimulus within the neuron's receptive field (Mitchell et al., 2007).The potential benefits of attention-dependent reductions in response variability depend critically on the degree to which the sources of variability are correlated across the population. Uncorrelated sources of response variability can, in principle, be mitigated by pooling signals across a neural population, with noise approaching zero when signals are pooled over a sufficiently large number of neurons. Thus, if the response variability that is diminished by attention (Mitchell et al., 2007) were independent across neurons, attention-dependent reductions of this variability might yield only a modest improvement in signal quality. This is not the case with variability that is shared across neurons. Such correlated variability cannot be abolished simply by pooling over a large neural population ([Britten et al., 1992] and [Zohary et al., 1994]).Uncorrelated noise, unique to each neuron's response, can arise from variability in synaptic transmission that is amplified by the threshold nonlinearity in spike generation ([Calvin and Stevens, 1967] and [Carandini, 2004]). Correlated activity results from shared inputs ([Moore et al., 1970], [Lytton and Sejnowski, 1991] and [Morita et al., 2008]). Shared variability is evidenced by correlations in firing between pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons. Previous studies have found significant correlations between neurons in visual cortex ([Zohary et al., 1994], [Shadlen and Newsome, 1998], [Bair et al., 2001] and [Kohn and Smith, 2005]). Correlations are not limited to local populations but persist even between neurons separated as much as 10 mm in cortex ([Smith and Kohn, 2008] and [Nauhaus et al., 2009]). Thus, fluctuations may be shared over very large neuronal populations including many thousands of cells. Because they are shared among many neurons, correlated fluctuations quickly would dominate as the source of noise in pooled measures of neuronal activity (Chen et al., 2006) and, depending on how information is read-out from populations, could impose severe limits on the accuracy of information represented (Zohary et al., 1994). It is thus important to determine whether attention decorrelates response variability that is shared across the population. {ResultsWe} recorded the responses of neurons in area V4, an intermediate stage of visual processing that has previously been found to be modulated by attention, in two macaques as they performed the attention-demanding tracking task depicted in Figure 1. Using this task, we could direct attention toward or away from a stimulus that we positioned within the neurons' receptive fields (Figure 1). We presented the same visual stimulus on all trials, providing a large number of identical stimulus repetitions from which to estimate variability in the neuronal response. On each trial, the stimulus paused and remained within the region of receptive field overlap for a period of 1000 ms, enabling us to estimate fluctuations in firing rate over a relatively long time period. Because the stimulus was constant during this period, the variability in firing reflects response fluctuations internal to cortex rather than stimulus-induced variability. As previously reported (Mitchell et al., 2007), we find that the spiking response of individual neurons was highly variable to repeated stimuli and that attention reduces this variability. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the responses of a single V4 neuron to 48 presentations of the identical stimulus. This neuron exhibited a robust response to the stimulus, which persisted through the pause period, until the stimulus left the receptive field. The raster plot at the top of the figure shows the neuron's response to this stimulus, on trials sorted according to whether attention was directed toward the stimulus in the receptive field ( ” Attended,” top) or was instead directed away from the receptive field ( ” Ignored,” middle). The left vertical yellow line indicates when the stimulus paused after entering the receptive field. The right yellow line shows the end of the 1000 ms pause period, when the stimulus initiated movement out of the receptive field. We characterized neuronal response variability with reference to the variability expected of a Poisson process, in which each spike occurs with a fixed probability that is independent of the neuron's spiking history. For a homogenous Poisson process, the variance of the number of spikes within a fixed time interval is equal to the mean spike count in that interval. The Fano factor (F), the ratio of spike count variance to mean spike count, is therefore 1 for a Poisson process. We computed the Fano factor in each of the attention conditions, over 100 ms time windows. As shown in the lower panel, Fano factor tended to be {\textgreater}1 for unattended responses (shown in blue), indicating response variability greater than would be expected for a Poisson process. We focused our analysis on the last 800 ms of the sustained period, during which the firing rate was relatively stable and free of response transients due to the stimulus entering the receptive field. When attention was directed into the receptive field, the Fano factor was significantly reduced (permutation test, p {\textless} 0.0001). Across the 191 neurons, there was a significant median reduction of Fano factor of

	abstract = {Noise driven exploration of a brain network's dynamic repertoire has been hypothesized to be causally involved in cognitive function, aging and neurodegeneration. The dynamic repertoire crucially depends on the network's capacity to store patterns, as well as their stability. Here we systematically explore the capacity of networks derived from human connectomes to store attractor states, as well as various network mechanisms to control the brain's dynamic repertoire. Using a deterministic graded response Hopfield model with connectome-based interactions, we reconstruct the system's attractor space through a uniform sampling of the initial conditions. Large fixed-point attractor sets are obtained in the low temperature condition, with a bigger number of attractors than ever reported so far. Different variants of the initial model, including (i) a uniform activation threshold or (ii) a global negative feedback, produce a similarly robust multistability in a limited parameter range. A numerical analysis of the distribution of the attractors identifies spatially-segregated components, with a centro-medial core and several well-delineated regional patches. Those different modes share similarity with the {fMRI} independent components observed in the "resting state" condition. We demonstrate non-stationary behavior in noise-driven generalizations of the models, with different meta-stable attractors visited along the same time course. Only the model with a global dynamic density control is found to display robust and long-lasting non-stationarity with no tendency toward either overactivity or extinction. The best fit with empirical signals is observed at the edge of multistability, a parameter region that also corresponds to the highest entropy of the attractors.},

	abstract = {The recent consensus is that virtually all aspects of response selectivity exhibited by the primary visual cortex are either created or sharpened by cortical inhibitory interneurons. Experimental studies have shown that there are cortical inhibitory cells that are driven by geniculate cells and that, like their cortical excitatory counterparts, are orientation selective, though less sharply tuned. The main goal of this article is to demonstrate how orientation-selective inhibition might be created by the circuitry of the primary visual cortex (striate cortex, V1) from its nonoriented geniculate inputs. To fulfill this goal, first, a Bayes-Markov computational model is developed for the V1 area dedicated to foveal vision. The developed model consists of three parts: (i) a two-layered hierarchical Markov random field that is assumed to generate the activity patterns of the geniculate and cortical inhibitory cells, (ii) a Bayesian computational goal that is formulated based on the maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimation principle, and (iii) an iterative, deterministic, parallel algorithm that leads the cortical circuitry to achieve its assigned computational goal. The developed model is not fully {LGN} driven and it is not implementable by the neural machinery of V1. The model, then, is transformed into a fully {LGN}-driven and physiologically plausible form. Computer simulation is used to demonstrate the performance of the developed models.},

	abstract = {The simultaneous recording of the activity of many neurons poses challenges for multivariate data analysis. Here, we propose a general scheme of reconstruction of the functional network from spike train recordings. Effective, causal interactions are estimated by fitting generalized linear models on the neural responses, incorporating effects of the neurons' self-history, of input from other neurons in the recorded network and of modulation by an external stimulus. The coupling terms arising from synaptic input can be transformed by thresholding into a binary connectivity matrix which is directed. Each link between two neurons represents a causal influence from one neuron to the other, given the observation of all other neurons from the population. The resulting graph is analyzed with respect to small-world and scale-free properties using quantitative measures for directed networks. Such graph-theoretic analyses have been performed on many complex dynamic networks, including the connectivity structure between different brain areas. Only few studies have attempted to look at the structure of cortical neural networks on the level of individual neurons. Here, using multi-electrode recordings from the visual system of the awake monkey, we find that cortical networks lack scale-free behavior, but show a small, but significant small-world structure. Assuming a simple distance-dependent probabilistic wiring between neurons, we find that this connectivity structure can account for all of the networks' observed small-world ness. Moreover, for multi-electrode recordings the sampling of neurons is not uniform across the population. We show that the small-world-ness obtained by such a localized sub-sampling overestimates the strength of the true small-world structure of the network. This bias is likely to be present in all previous experiments based on multi-electrode recordings.},

	abstract = {Abstract Phase congruency is a low-level invariant property of image features. Interest in low-level image invariants has been limited. This is surprising, considering the fundamental importance of being able to obtain reliable results from low-level image operations in order to successfully perform any higher level operations. However, an impediment to the use of phase congruency to detect features has been its sensitivity to noise. This paper extends the theory behind the calculation of phase congruency in a number of ways. An effective method of noise compensation is presented that only assumes that the noise power spectrum is approximately constant. Problems with the localization of features are addressed by introducing a new, more sensitive measure of phase congruency. The existing theory that has been developed for 1D signals is extended to allow the calculation of phase congruency in 2D images. Finally, it is argued that high-pass filtering should be used to obtain image information at different scales. With this approach, the choice of scale only affects the relative significance of features without degrading their localization.},

First, the responses of single neurons were measured along each stimulus dimension, using analysis intervals comparable to a normal fixation interval (200 ms). Second, the measured responses of each neuron were fitted with simple descriptive functions, containing a few free parameters, for each stimulus dimension. These functions were found to account for approximately 90\% of the variance in the measured response means and response standard deviations. (A detailed analysis of the relationship between the mean and the variance showed that the variance is proportional to the mean.) Third, the parameters of the best-fitting descriptive functions were utilized in conjunction with Bayesian (optimal) decision theory to determine the detection, discrimination, and identification performance for each neuron, along each stimulus dimension. For some of the cells in monkey, discrimination performance was comparable to behavioral performance; for most of the cells in cat, discrimination performance was better than behavioral performance. The behavioral contrast and spatial-frequency discrimination functions were similar in shape to the envelope of the most sensitive cells; they were also similar to the discrimination functions obtained by optimal pooling of the entire population of cells. The statistics which summarize the parameters of the descriptive functions were used to estimate the response of the visual cortex as a whole to a complex natural image. The analysis suggests that individual cortical neurons can reliably signal precise information about the location, size, and orientation of local image features.},

	abstract = {Spike sorting, i.e., the separation of the firing activity of different neurons from extracellular measurements, is a crucial but often error-prone step in the analysis of neuronal responses. Usually, three different problems have to be solved: the detection of spikes in the extracellular recordings, the estimation of the number of neurons and their prototypical (template) spike waveforms, and the assignment of individual spikes to those putative neurons. If the template spike waveforms are known, template matching can be used to solve the detection and classification problem. Here, we show that for the colored Gaussian noise case the optimal template matching is given by a form of linear filtering, which can be derived via linear discriminant analysis. This provides a Bayesian interpretation for the well-known matched filter output. Moreover, with this approach it is possible to compute a spike detection threshold analytically. The method can be implemented by a linear filter bank derived from the templates, and can be used for online spike sorting of multielectrode recordings. It may also be applicable to detection and classification problems of transient signals in general. Its application significantly decreases the error rate on two publicly available spike-sorting benchmark data sets in comparison to state-of-the-art template matching procedures. Finally, we explore the possibility to resolve overlapping spikes using the template matching outputs and show that they can be resolved with high accuracy.},

We recorded neuronal activity from multielectrode arrays as they were stepped through area {MT}. The set of recording sites in each array penetration described a plane parallel to the cortical layers. At each recording site, we determined the preferred direction of motion. Responses recorded at successive locations from the same electrode in the array revealed gradual changes in preferred direction, along with occasional directional reversals. Comparisons of responses from adjacent electrodes at successive locations enabled electrophysiological imaging of the two-dimensional pattern of preferred directions across the cortex. Our results demonstrate a systematic organization for directionality in area {MT} of the New World Cebus monkey, which is similar to that known to exist in the Old World macaque. In addition, our results provide electrophysiological confirmation of map features that have been documented in other cortical areas and primate species by optical imaging. Specifically, the tangential organization of directional selectivity is characterized by slow continuous changes in directional preference, as well as lines (fractures) and points (singularities) that fragment continuous regions into patches. These electrophysiological methods also allowed a direct investigation of neuronal selectivities that give rise to map features. In particular, our results suggest that inhibitory mechanisms may be involved in the generation of fractures and singularities.},

Definitions of ontologies vary widely, as do the values and philosophies that underlie them. In seeking to make these views explicit, we conducted and summarized interviews with a dozen leading ontologists. Their views clustered into three broad perspectives that we summarize as mathematics, computer code, and Esperanto. Ontology as mathematics puts the ultimate premium on rigor and logic, symmetry and consistency of representation across scientific subfields, and the inclusion of only established, non-contradictory knowledge. Ontology as computer code focuses on utility and cultivates diversity, fitting ontologies to their purpose. Like computer languages C++, Prolog, and {HTML}, the code perspective holds that diverse applications warrant custom designed ontologies. Ontology as Esperanto focuses on facilitating cross-disciplinary communication, knowledge cross-referencing, and computation across datasets from diverse communities. We show how these views align with classical divides in science and suggest how a synthesis of their concerns could strengthen the next generation of biomedical ontologies.},

The average exponent (0.54) is in the range expected from contrast increment detection literature. The effect of contrast on performance is predicted very well.

To test if, and to what extent, foveal and peripheral information are integrated, we examined human orientation-discrimination performance across saccadic eye movements. We found that humans perform best when an oriented target is visible both before (peripherally) and after a saccade (foveally), suggesting that humans integrate the two views. Integration relied on eye movements, as we found no evidence of integration when the target was artificially moved during stationary viewing. Perturbation analysis revealed that humans combine the two views using a weighted sum, with weights assigned based on the relative precision of foveal and peripheral representations, as predicted by ideal observer models. However, our subjects displayed a systematic overweighting of the fovea, relative to the ideal observer, indicating that human integration across saccades is slightly suboptimal.},

Here, we use a novel Pavlovian conditioning task, embedded in a normative framework, to directly assess how trait optimism, as classically measured using self-report questionnaires, influences choices between visual targets, by learning about their association with reward progresses. We find that trait optimism relates to an a priori belief about the likelihood of rewards, but not losses, in our task. Critically, this positive belief behaves like a probabilistic prior, i.e. its influence reduces with increasing experience. Contrary to findings in the literature related to unrealistic optimism and self-beliefs, it does not appear to influence the iterative learning process directly.},

Under natural assumptions on the synaptic connectivity we show how one can derive an equivalent partial differential equation ({PDE}) model that properly treats the axonal delay terms of the integral formulation. Our analysis avoids the so-called long-wavelength approximation that has previously been used to formulate {PDE} models for neural activity in two spatial dimensions. Direct numerical simulations of this {PDE} model show instabilities of the homogeneous steady state that are in full agreement with a Turing instability analysis of the original integral model. We discuss the benefits of such a local model and its usefulness in modeling electrocortical activity. In particular, we are able to treat "patchy" connections, whereby a homogeneous and isotropic system is modulated in a spatially periodic fashion. In this case the emergence of a "lattice-directed" traveling wave predicted by a linear instability analysis is confirmed by the numerical simulation of an appropriate set of coupled {PDEs}.},

	abstract = {Our ability to explore our surroundings requires a combination of high-resolution vision and frequent rotations of the visual axis toward objects of interest. Such gaze shifts are themselves a source of powerful retinal stimulation, and so the visual system appears to have evolved mechanisms to maintain perceptual stability during movements of the eyes in space. The mechanisms underlying this perceptual stability can be probed in the laboratory by briefly presenting a stimulus around the time of a saccadic eye movement and asking subjects to report its position. Under such conditions, there is a systematic misperception of the probes toward the saccade end point. This perisaccadic compression of visual space has been the subject of much research, but few studies have attempted to relate it to specific brain mechanisms. Here, we show that the magnitude of perceptual compression for a wide variety of probe stimuli and saccade amplitudes is quantitatively predicted by a simple heuristic model based on the geometry of retinotopic representations in the primate brain. Specifically, we propose that perisaccadic compression is determined by the distance between the probe and saccade end point on a map that has a logarithmic representation of visual space, similar to those found in numerous cortical and subcortical visual structures. Under this assumption, the psychophysical data on perisaccadic compression can be appreciated intuitively by imagining that, around the time of a saccade, the brain confounds nearby oculomotor and sensory signals while attempting to localize the position of objects in visual space.},

Currently the evaluation of biologically inspired motion estimation models lacks a proper methodology for comparing their performance against behavioural and psychophysical data. Here we set the basis for such a new benchmark methodology based on human visual performance and designed a database of image sequences taken from neuroscience and psychophysics literature. In this article we focused on two fundamental aspects of motion estimation, which are the respective influence between 1d versus 2d cues and the dynamics of motion integration. Since motion models deal with many kinds of motion representations and scales, we defined two general readouts based on a global motion estimation. Such readouts, namely eye movements and perceived motion, will serve as a reference to compare simulated and experimental data. Baseline results are provided for biologically inspired artificial vision models but also for computer vision models. As a whole we provide here the basis for a valuable evaluation methodology to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of motion perception in the visual cortex.

Here I derive theoretical conditions for a spiking model to be insensitive to input level. The key property is a dynamic change in spike threshold. I then show how level invariance can be physiologically implemented, with specific ionic channel properties. It appears that these ingredients are indeed present in monaural neurons of the sound localization pathway of birds and mammals.},

We tested the predictions of two models of the saccadic burst generator by electrically stimulating sites in primate superior colliculus ({SC}) immediately following visually guided movements. 2. The amplitude and direction of stimulated saccades depend systematically on the amplitude and direction of preceding visually guided saccades, and that effect decays exponentially with a time constant of approximately 45 ms. The saccadic system, then, displays an amplitude-dependent non-stationarity that follows an exponential time course during the intersaccadic interval ({ISI}). 3. These results are consistent with a variant of the eye displacement model proposed by Jurgens et al. but not with Robinson's classic model of the burst generator. Moreover, since all models of saccadic control must predict either stationary or nonstationary behavior during the {ISI}, these results provide a powerful new constraint on those models. 4. Finally, the success of the displacement model in accounting for our data suggests a new explanation for the results of colliding saccade experiments.},

We build on the work of Perry and Geisler [1998; 2002], who manipulate spatial resolution as a function of gaze direction, allowing them to mimic the resolution distribution of the human retina or to simulate the effect of various diseases (e.g. glaucoma).Our temporal filtering algorithm is similar to that of Perry and Geisler in that we interpolate between the levels of a multiresolution pyramid. However, in our case, the pyramid is built along the temporal dimension, and this requires careful management of the buffering of video frames and of the order in which the filtering operations are performed. On a standard personal computer, the algorithm achieves real-time performance (30 frames per second) on high-resolution videos (960 by 540 pixels).We present experimental results showing that the manipulation performed by the algorithm reduces the number of high-amplitude saccades and can remain unnoticed by the observer.},

These require that neurons be labeled with response parameters, such as tuning curve peaks or noise distributions, which are tied to some external, world-based metric scale. Firing rates alone, without this external labeling, are insufficient to represent a variable. However, the extrinsic approach does not explain how such neural labeling is implemented. A radically different and perhaps more physiological approach is based on intrinsic representations, which have access only to firing rates. Because neurons are unlabeled, intrinsic coding represents relative, rather than absolute, values of a variable. We show that intrinsic coding has representational advantages, including invariance, categorization, and discrimination, and in certain situations it may also recover absolute stimulus values.},

This eye position signal is consistent with a fusimotor response (Taylor A, Durbaba R, Ellaway {PH}, Rawlinson S. J Physiol 571: 711-723, 2006) and has two components during a visually guided saccade task: a short-latency phasic response followed by a tonic response. While the early phasic response can be excitatory or inhibitory, it does not accurately reflect the eye's orbital position. The late tonic response appears to carry the proprioceptive eye position signal, but it is not clear when this component emerges and whether the onset of this signal is reliable. To test the temporal dynamics of the tonic proprioceptive signal, we used an oculomotor smooth pursuit task in which saccadic eye movements and phasic proprioceptive responses are suppressed. Our results show that the tonic proprioceptive eye position signal consistently lags the actual eye position in the orbit by ∼60 ms under a variety of eye movement conditions. To confirm the proprioceptive nature of this signal, we also studied the responses of neurons in a vestibuloocular reflex ({VOR}) task in which the direction of gaze was held constant; response profiles and delay times were similar in this task, suggesting that this signal does not represent angle of gaze and does not receive visual or vestibular inputs. The length of the delay suggests that the proprioceptive eye position signal is unlikely to be used for online visual processing for action, although it could be used to calibrate an efference copy signal.},

Three additions to the sequence compression model underlie the sparse representation: synapses connecting the neurons of the network that are subject to {STDP}, a competitive plasticity rule so that neurons specialize to individual sequences, and neural depolarization after spiking so that neurons have a memory. The response to new sequence elements is determined by the neurons that have responded to the previous subsequence, according to the competitively learned synaptic connections.

Among these, the energy model proposes the summation of quadrature pairs following a squaring nonlinearity in order to explain phase invariance of complex V1 cells. The divisive normalization model assumes a gain-controlling, divisive inhibition to explain sigmoid-like response profiles within a pool of neurons. A gaussian-like operation hypothesizes a bell-shaped response tuned to a specific, optimal pattern of activation of the presynaptic inputs. A max-like operation assumes the selection and transmission of the most active response among a set of neural inputs. We propose that these distinct neural operations can be computed by the same canonical circuitry, involving divisive normalization and polynomial nonlinearities, for different parameter values within the circuit. Hence, this canonical circuit may provide a unifying framework for several circuit models, such as the divisive normalization and the energy models. As a case in point, we consider a feedforward hierarchical model of the ventral pathway of the primate visual cortex, which is built on a combination of the gaussian-like and max-like operations. We show that when the two operations are approximated by the circuit proposed here, the model is capable of generating selective and invariant neural responses and performing object recognition, in good agreement with neurophysiological data.},

	abstract = {Detecting the direction of image motion is important for visual navigation as well as predator, prey and mate detection and, thus, essential for the survival of all animals that have eyes. However, the direction of motion is not explicitly represented at the level of the photoreceptors: it rather needs to be computed by subsequent neural circuits, involving a comparison of the signals from neighbouring photoreceptors over time. The exact nature of this process as implemented at the neuronal level has been a long-standing question in the field. Only recently, much progress has been made in Drosophila by genetically targeting individual neuron types to block, activate or record from them. The results obtained this way indicate that: (i) luminance information from fly photoreceptors R1-6 is split into two parallel motion circuits, specialized to detect the motion of luminance increments ({ON}-Channel) and decrements ({OFF}-Channel) separately; (ii) lamina neurons L1 and L2 are the primary input neurons to these circuits (L1 → {ON}-channel, L2 → {OFF}-channel); and (iii) T4 and T5 cells carry their output signals ({ON} → T4, {OFF} → T5). {\textbackslash}copyright 2014 Federation of European Neuroscience Societies and John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

Recent studies found human response times to be as fast as 120 ms in a dual-presentation (2-{AFC}) setup (H. Kirchner \& S. J. Thorpe, 2005). In most previous experiments, pairs of randomly chosen images were presented, frequently from very different contexts (e.g., a zebra in Africa vs. the New York Skyline). Here, we tested the effect of background size and contiguity on human performance by using a new, contiguous background image set. Individual images contained a single animal surrounded by a large, animal-free image area. The image could be positioned and cropped in such a manner that the animal could occur in one of eight evenly spaced positions on an imaginary circle (radius 10-deg visual angle). In the first (8-Choice) experiment, all eight positions were used, whereas in the second (2-Choice) and third (2-Image) experiments, the animals were only presented on the two positions to the left and right of the screen center. In the third experiment, additional rectangular frames were used to mimic the conditions of earlier studies. Average latencies on successful trials differed only slightly between conditions, indicating that the number of possible animal locations within the display does not affect decision latency. Detailed analysis of saccade targets revealed a preference toward both the head and the center of gravity of the target animal, affecting hit ratio, latency, and the number of saccades required to reach the target. These results illustrate that rapid animal detection operates scene-wide and is fast and efficient even when the animals are embedded in their natural backgrounds.},

Observers were asked to judge which half of a display had dots that were moving faster. This was done under two main conditions: when dot motion appeared to continue across the boundary between the two halves, and when it moved parallel to the boundary. Speed discrimination thresholds were elevated when motion in the two halves appeared to cross the boundary compared to the case when motion was parallel to the boundary. Extensive practice improved performance until speed discrimination in the two cases was virtually indistinguishable. The addition of noise caused the original effect to reappear, i.e., thresholds were elevated when motion continued across the border. Our results suggest that the local differences in velocity on either side of border are ignored when motion appears to cross the border. Instead the visual system seems to enforce an a priori assumption that when motion continues across a boundary it belongs to a common motion path.},

For example patch-suppressed cells respond to gratings of a specific orientation within their classical receptive field, but the response diminishes if the grating is expanded to cover the surrounding area. We report here more complex effects in many such cells. When stimulated at their optimal orientation, introducing a surrounding field at a significantly different (for example, orthogonal) orientation enhanced their output by both a disinhibitory mechanism and an active facilitatory mechanism producing 'supra-optimal' responses. Importantly, some cells responded well if the orientations of centre and surround stimuli were swapped. The output reflected the discontinuity because neither stimulus component alone was effective. Under these stimulus conditions simultaneously recorded cells with orthogonally oriented receptive fields showed correlated firing consistent with neuronal binding to the configuration. We propose a mechanism integrating orientation-dependent information over adjacent areas of visual space to represent focal orientation discontinuities such as junctions or corners.},

This population activity is often characterized experimentally by the distribution of multineuron “words” (binary firing vectors), and a match between spontaneous and evoked word distributions has been suggested to reflect learning of a probabilistic model of the sensory world. We analyzed multineuron word distributions in sensory cortex of anesthetized rats and cats, and found that they are dominated by fluctuations in population firing rate rather than precise interactions between individual units. Furthermore, cortical word distributions change when brain state shifts, and similar behavior is seen in simulated networks with fixed, random connectivity. Our results suggest that similarity or dissimilarity in multineuron word distributions could primarily reflect similarity or dissimilarity in population firing rate dynamics, and not necessarily the precise interactions between neurons that would indicate learning of sensory features.},

A similar dynamics was found for human reflexive or voluntary tracking. Here, we bring an essential, but still missing, piece of information by documenting macaque ocular following responses to gratings, unikinetic plaids, and barber-poles. We found that ocular tracking was always initiated first in the grating motion direction with ultra-short latencies (approximately 55 ms). A second component was driven only 10-15 ms later, rotating tracking toward pattern motion direction. At the end the open-loop period, tracking direction was aligned with pattern motion direction (plaids) or the average of the line-ending motion directions (barber-poles). We characterized the dependency on contrast of each component. Both timing and direction of ocular following were quantitatively very consistent with the dynamics of neuronal responses reported by others. Overall, we found a remarkable consistency between neuronal dynamics and monkey behavior, advocating for a direct link between the neuronal solution of the aperture problem and primate perception and action.},

Sensitivity to patterns is fundamental to sensory processing, in particular in the auditory system, because most auditory signals only have meaning as successions over time. Previous evidence suggests that the brain is tuned to the statistics of sensory stimulation. However, the process through which this arises has been elusive. We demonstrate that listeners are remarkably sensitive to the emergence of complex patterns within rapidly evolving sound sequences, performing on par with an ideal observer model. Brain responses reveal online processes of evidence accumulation-dynamic changes in tonic activity precisely correlate with the expected precision or predictability of ongoing auditory input-both in terms of deterministic (first-order) structure and the entropy of random sequences. Source analysis demonstrates an interaction between primary auditory cortex, hippocampus, and inferior frontal gyrus in the process of discovering the regularity within the ongoing sound sequence. The results are consistent with precision based predictive coding accounts of perceptual inference and provide compelling neurophysiological evidence of the brain's capacity to encode high-order temporal structure in sensory signals.},

The oculomotor system continually brings targets of interest into the fovea via ballistic eye movements (saccades). Thus, the fovea serves both as the locus for fixations and as the oculomotor reference for saccades. This highly automated process of foveation is functionally critical to vision and is observed from infancy [1 and 2]. How would the oculomotor system adjust to a loss of foveal vision (central scotoma)? Clinical observations of patients with central vision loss [3 and 4] suggest a lengthy adjustment period [5], but the nature and dynamics of this adjustment remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the oculomotor system can spontaneously and rapidly adopt a peripheral locus for fixation and can rereference saccades to this locus in normally sighted individuals whose central vision is blocked by an artificial scotoma. Once developed, the fixation locus is retained over weeks in the absence of the simulated scotoma. Our data reveal a basic guiding principle of the oculomotor system that prefers control simplicity over optimality. We demonstrate the importance of a visible scotoma on the speed of the adjustment and suggest a possible rehabilitation regimen for patients with central vision loss.},

In contrast, pursuit training did not affect overestimation in either pursuit or perception, even though observers in both training groups were exposed to the same stimuli for the same time period. A second experiment revealed that estimation training also improved discrimination, indicating that overestimation may optimize perceptual sensitivity.

	abstract = {Human choice behavior takes account of internal decision costs: people show a tendency to avoid making decisions in ways that are computationally demanding and subjectively effortful. Here, we investigate neural processes underlying the registration of decision costs. We report two functional {MRI} experiments that implicate lateral prefrontal cortex ({LPFC}) in this function. In Experiment 1, {LPFC} activity correlated positively with a self-report measure of costs as this measure varied over blocks of simple decisions. In Experiment 2, {LPFC} activity also correlated with individual differences in effort-based choice, taking on higher levels in subjects with a strong tendency to avoid cognitively demanding decisions. These relationships persisted even when effects of reaction time and error were partialled out, linking {LPFC} activity to subjectively experienced costs and not merely to response accuracy or time on task. In contrast to {LPFC}, dorsomedial frontal cortex—an area widely implicated in performance monitoring—showed no relationship to decision costs independent of overt performance. Previous work has implicated {LPFC} in executive control. Our results thus imply that costs may be registered based on the degree to which control mechanisms are recruited during decision-making.},

Little is known about the cost incurred by animals and humans for acquiring additional information from sensory variables due, for instance, to attentional efforts. Through a novel integration of diffusion models and dynamic programming, we were able to estimate the cost of making additional observations per unit of time from two monkeys and six humans in a reaction time ({RT}) random-dot motion discrimination task. Surprisingly, we find that the cost is neither zero nor constant over time, but for the animals and humans features a brief period in which it is constant but increases thereafter. In addition, we show that our theory accurately matches the observed reaction time distributions for each stimulus condition, the time-dependent choice accuracy both conditional on stimulus strength and independent of it, and choice accuracy and mean reaction times as a function of stimulus strength. The theory also correctly predicts that urgency signals in the brain should be independent of the difficulty, or stimulus strength, at each trial.},

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the relative conspicuousness of bone marrow lesions on images obtained by using two of the most widely available fat-suppression techniques, short-{TI} inversion recovery ({STIR}) and fat-saturation T2-weighted imaging, and to analyze the effect of these methods on image quality. In addition, we sought to determine if either or both of these sequences provide significant advantages relative to conventional T1-weighted spin-echo images for the evaluation of bone marrow lesions. {SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS}: T1-weighted (600/15 [{TR}/{TE}]), {STIR} (2500/20/160 [{TR}/{TE}/{TI}]), and fat-saturation T2-weighted (2500/20-70) {MR} images were obtained with a 1.5-T system in 34 consecutive patients with suspected bone marrow lesions. The conspicuousness of 36 lesions was evaluated subjectively by three radiologists, who also evaluated the {MR} images for how well they showed margination and extent of the lesion, image uniformity, motion artifacts, and overall image quality. In addition, lesion contrast on these sequences was compared quantitatively by using percentage contrast measurements. {RESULTS}: Lesions were qualitatively equally conspicuous with all four pulse sequences. Quantitative measurements indicated that lesions were more conspicuous on fat-saturation T2-weighted and {STIR} images than on T1-weighted images (p {\textless} .001). Differences between the first two sequences were not significant. Factors related to image quality, including reduction in motion artifacts and image uniformity, were generally superior on T1-weighted images. {CONCLUSION}: T1-weighted, fat-saturation T2-weighted, and {STIR} sequences all provide a high degree of sensitivity for depiction of most types of bone marrow abnormalities. Although the conspicuousness of lesions is similar on fat-saturation T2-weighted and {STIR} images, the former sequence has several practical advantages, including acquisition of more slices per unit time and improved tissue specificity. The combination of T1-weighted and either fat-saturation T2-weighted or {STIR} images is highly effective for the evaluation of bone marrow lesions.},

	abstract = {We show how the success of deep learning depends not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can be approximated through "cheap learning" with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones, because they have simplifying properties tracing back to the laws of physics. The exceptional simplicity of physics-based functions hinges on properties such as symmetry, locality, compositionality and polynomial log-probability, and we explore how these properties translate into exceptionally simple neural networks approximating both natural phenomena such as images and abstract representations thereof such as drawings. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to renormalization group procedures. Various "no-flattening theorems" show when these efficient deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss - even for linear networks.},

	abstract = {Detecting the temporal relationship among events in the environment is a fundamental goal of the brain. Following pulses of rhythmic stimuli, neurons of the retina and cortex produce activity that closely approximates the timing of an omitted pulse. This omitted stimulus response ({OSR}) is generally interpreted as a transient response to rhythmic input and is thought to form a basis of short-term perceptual memories. Despite its ubiquity across species and experimental protocols, the mechanisms underlying {OSRs} remain poorly understood. In particular, the highly transient nature of {OSRs}, typically limited to a single cycle after stimulation, cannot be explained by a simple mechanism that would remain locked to the frequency of stimulation. Here, we describe a set of realistic simulations that capture {OSRs} over a range of stimulation frequencies matching experimental work. The model does not require an explicit mechanism for learning temporal sequences. Instead, it relies on spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}), a form of synaptic modification that is sensitive to the timing of pre- and post-synaptic action potentials. In the model, the transient nature of {OSRs} is attributed to the heterogeneous nature of neural properties and connections, creating intricate forms of activity that are continuously changing over time. Combined with {STDP}, neural heterogeneity enabled {OSRs} to complex rhythmic patterns as well as {OSRs} following a delay period. These results link the response of neurons to rhythmic patterns with the capacity of heterogeneous circuits to produce transient and highly flexible forms of neural activity.},

In these experimental embodiments, complex networks of coupled atomic switches exhibit emergent criticality similar in nature to previously reported electrical activity of biological brains and neuron assemblies. Rapid fluctuations in electrical conductance display metastability and power law scaling of temporal correlation lengths that are attributed to dynamic reorganization of the interconnected electro-ionic network resulting from induced non-equilibrium thermodynamic instabilities. These collective properties indicate a potential utility for real-time, multi-input processing of distributed sensory data through reservoir computation.

Numerous studies have shown that correlations can be dynamically modified by attention, adaptation, learning, and potent stimulus drive. However, the mechanisms that influence correlation strength remain poorly understood. Here we test whether correlations are influenced by presenting stimuli outside the classical receptive field ({RF}) of visual neurons, where they recruit a normalization signal termed surround suppression. We recorded simultaneously the activity of dozens of cells using microelectrode arrays implanted in the superficial layers of V1 in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. We presented annular stimuli that encircled-but did not impinge upon-the {RFs} of the recorded cells. We found that these "extra-classical" stimuli reduced correlations in the absence of stimulation of the {RF}, closely resembling the decorrelating effects of stimulating the {RFs} directly. Our results suggest that normalization signals may be an important mechanism for modulating correlations.},

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: The computational role of primary visual cortex (V1) in low-level perception remains largely debated. A dominant view assumes the prevalence of higher cortical areas and top-down processes in binding information across the visual field. Here, we investigated the role of long-distance intracortical connections in form and motion processing by measuring, with intracellular recordings, their synaptic impact on neurons in area 17 (V1) of the anesthetized cat. By systematically mapping synaptic responses to stimuli presented in the nonspiking surround of V1 receptive fields, we provide the first quantitative characterization of the lateral functional connectivity kernel of V1 neurons. Our results revealed at the population level two structural-functional biases in the synaptic integration and dynamic association properties of V1 neurons. First, subthreshold responses to oriented stimuli flashed in isolation in the nonspiking surround exhibited a geometric organization around the preferred orientation axis mirroring the psychophysical "association field" for collinear contour perception. Second, apparent motion stimuli, for which horizontal and feedforward synaptic inputs summed in-phase, evoked dominantly facilitatory nonlinear interactions, specifically during centripetal collinear activation along the preferred orientation axis, at saccadic-like speeds. This spatiotemporal integration property, which could constitute the neural correlate of a human perceptual bias in speed detection, suggests that local (orientation) and global (motion) information is already linked within V1. We propose the existence of a "dynamic association field" in V1 neurons, whose spatial extent and anisotropy are transiently updated and reshaped as a function of changes in the retinal flow statistics imposed during natural oculomotor exploration. {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}: The computational role of primary visual cortex in low-level perception remains debated. The expression of this "pop-out" perception is often assumed to require attention-related processes, such as top-down feedback from higher cortical areas. Using intracellular techniques in the anesthetized cat and novel analysis methods, we reveal unexpected structural-functional biases in the synaptic integration and dynamic association properties of V1 neurons. These structural-functional biases provide a substrate, within V1, for contour detection and, more unexpectedly, global motion flow sensitivity at saccadic speed, even in the absence of attentional processes. We argue for the concept of a "dynamic association field" in V1 neurons, whose spatial extent and anisotropy changes with retinal flow statistics, and more generally for a renewed focus on intracortical computation.},

	abstract = {A neural model is developed of how motion integration and segmentation processes, both within and across apertures, compute global motion percepts. Figure-ground properties, such as occlusion, influence which motion signals determine the percept. For visible apertures, a line's terminators do not specify true line motion. For invisible apertures, a line's intrinsic terminators create veridical feature-tracking signals. Sparse feature-tracking signals can be amplified before they propagate across position and are integrated with ambiguous motion signals within line interiors. This integration process determines the global percept. It is the result of several processing stages: directional transient cells respond to image transients and input to a directional short-range filter that selectively boosts feature-tracking signals with the help of competitive signals. Then, a long-range filter inputs to directional cells that pool signals over multiple orientations, opposite contrast polarities, and depths. This all happens no later than cortical area {MT}. The directional cells activate a directional grouping network, proposed to occur within cortical area {MST}, within which directions compete to determine a local winner. Enhanced feature-tracking signals typically win over ambiguous motion signals. Model {MST} cells that encode the winning direction feed back to model {MT} cells, where they boost directionally consistent cell activities and suppress inconsistent activities over the spatial region to which they project. This feedback accomplishes directional and depthful motion capture within that region. Model simulations include the barberpole illusion, motion capture, the spotted barberpole, the triple barberpole, the occluded translating square illusion, motion transparency and the chopsticks illusion. Qualitative explanations of illusory contours from translating terminators and plaid adaptation are also given.},

	abstract = {An important use of motion information is to segment a complex visual scene into surfaces and objects. Transparent motions present a particularly difficult problem for segmentation because more than one velocity vector occurs at each local region in the image, and current machine vision systems fail in these circumstances. The fact that motion transparency is prevalent in natural scenes, and yet artificial systems display an inability to analyze it, suggests that the primate visual system has developed specialized methods for perceiving transparent motion. Also, the currently prevalent model of physiological mechanisms for motion-direction selectivity employs inhibitory interactions between neurons; such interactions would silence neurons under transparent conditions and render the visual system blind to transparent motion. To examine how the primate visual system solves this transparency problem, we recorded the activity of direction-selective cells in the first (area V1) and in a later (area {MT}) stage in the cortical motion-processing pathway in behaving monkeys. The visual stimuli consisted of random dot patterns forming single moving surfaces, transparent surfaces, and motion discontinuities. We found that area V1 cells responded to their preferred direction of movement even under transparent conditions, whereas area {MT} cells were suppressed under the transparent condition. These data suggest a simple solution to the transparency problem at the level of area V1. More than one motion vector can be represented at a single retinal location by different subpopulations of neurons tuned to different directions of motion; these subpopulations may represent the early stage for segmenting different, transparent surfaces. The results also suggest that facilitatory mechanisms, which unlike inhibitory interactions are largely unaffected by transparent conditions, play an important role in direction selectivity in area V1. The inhibitory interactions for different motion directions for area {MT} neurons may contribute to a mechanism for smoothing or averaging the velocity field, computations thought to be necessary for reducing noise and interpolating moving surfaces from sparse information.},

To examine this question, we have developed a large-scale neuronal network model of layer 4Calpha in V1 of the macaque cortex that is based on, and constrained by, realistic cortical anatomy and physiology. This paper has two aims: (1) to show that neurons in the model respond like simple cells. (2) To identify how the model generates this linearized response in a nonlinear network. Each neuron in the model receives nonlinear excitation from the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}). The cells of the model receive strong (nonlinear) lateral inhibition from other neurons in the model cortex. Mathematical analysis of the dependence of membrane potential on synaptic conductances, and computer simulations, reveal that the nonlinearity of corticocortical inhibition cancels the nonlinear excitatory input from the {LGN}. This interaction produces linearized responses that agree with both extracellular and intracellular measurements. The model correctly accounts for experimental results about the time course of simple cell responses and also generates testable predictions about variation in linearity with position in the cortex, and the effect on the linearity of signal summation, caused by unbalancing the relative strengths of excitation and inhibition pharmacologically or with extrinsic current.},

Nor does attention alter direction-selective masking by multiple wavelets moving in random directions, a condition designed to isolate effects on component motion. However, direction-selective masking by multiple wavelets moving in parallel is significantly reduced by attention. As the latter condition is expected to excite both component and pattern motion mechanisms, this implies that attention may alter the visual representation of pattern motion.

	abstract = {Neurons in the visual system have been characterized for decades using predefined sequences of stimuli that sample a limited portion of sensory space. Ideally, it should be possible to adaptively modify the stimuli for each individual neuron to explore larger portions of stimulus space in a ?closed-loop? manner (i.e. the stimuli are modified based on the response of the neuron ? ?the response of the neuron increases as more effective stimuli are found ?? the new stimuli are again modified to increase the neuronal response even further). We have tested different approaches of adaptive stimulus sampling to characterize the response properties of thalamic (lateral geniculate nucleus ?{LGN}?) and cortical (area V1) neurons in the cat. A simple algorithm based on neuronal spike count was remarkably effective at optimizing binary white noise stimuli for {LGN} neurons. The optimization process was started by presenting a binary noise stimulus. In each iteration of the optimization, we calculated the response maps for black and white pixels. Thresholding these maps provided the main cluster of pixels that were driving the neuron. Once the main pixel cluster was obtained, the stimuli for the following iterations were generated by surrounding the main cluster with a ring of random pixels. Interestingly, we had to introduce spatial correlations among the ring pixels to make the stimulus optimization more effective. The resulting optimal stimulus ensemble revealed more effectively the structure of the receptive field surround than classical reverse correlation methods. The optimization of white noise stimuli for cortical neurons was more challenging and we are still working on different approaches to make the optimization efficient. At this time, one of the most successful approaches is based on a Particle Swarm Optimization ({PSO})1 algorithm that optimizes sequences of spatiotemporal noise pixels based on isolated single neuron responses. The {PSO} is a population based technique in which particles move around in a search-space to locate the optimum. Social interactions among particles (and the history of individual particles) are then used to update the particles positions. In our case, a particle represented one sequence of spatiotemporal pixels and the search-space was the entity of the luminance values of all pixels. The {PSO} algorithm was able to optimize stimulus sequences to drive strong and reliable responses in both linear and nonlinear cortical neurons. Preliminary results suggest that the optimization is remarkably restricted in cortical space (i.e. neighboring V1 neurons that were just a few hundred microns away from the optimized neuron did not show robust increases in firing rate during the optimization process). Taken together, adaptive sampling provides a powerful approach to optimize white noise stimuli for single {LGN} and V1 neurons with linear and nonlinear receptive fields. Our preliminary data suggests that this optimization can be remarkably restricted in cortical space, providing new insights into the amount of redundancy in the visual cortex.},

	abstract = {Cortical neurons recorded in vivo exhibit highly variable responses to the repeated presentation of the same stimulus. To further understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we performed intracellular recordings from neurons in cat striate cortex in vivo and examined the relationships between spontaneous activity and visually evoked responses. Activity was assessed on a trial-by-trial basis by measuring the membrane potential (V m) fluctuations and spike activity during brief epochs immediately before and after the onset of an evoked response. We found that the response magnitude, expressed as a change in V m relative to baseline, was linearly correlated with the preceding {spontaneousV} m. This correlation was enhanced when the cells were hyperpolarized to reduce the activation of voltage-gated conductances. The output of the cells, expressed as spike counts and latencies, was only moderately correlated with fluctuations in the preceding spontaneous V m. Spike-triggered averaging of V m revealed that visually evoked action potentials arise from transient depolarizations having a rise time of ∼10 msec. Consistent with this, evoked spike count was found to be linearly correlated with the magnitude {ofV} m fluctuations in the γ (20–70 Hz) frequency band. We also found that the threshold of visually evoked action potentials varied over a range of ∼10 {mV}. Examination of simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular activity revealed a correlation between V mdepolarization and spike discharges in adjacent cells. Together these results demonstrate that response variability is attributable largely to coherent fluctuations in cortical activity preceding the onset of a stimulus, but also to variations in action potential threshold and the magnitude of high-frequency fluctuations evoked by the stimulus.},

These functions are adapted to minimize the estimated code length under a model that assumes images are composed of a linear superposition of sparse, independent components. When adapted to natural images, the wavelet bases take on different orientations and they evenly tile the orientation domain, in stark contrast to the standard, non-oriented wavelet bases used in image compression.

Imagine, for instance, looking out of the window of a bus on a bright day, where the world outside the window is passing by and movements of passengers inside the bus are reflected in the window. The overlay of both motions at the window leads to motion transparency, which is challenging to process. Noisy and ambiguous motion signals can be reduced using a competition mechanism for all encoded motions in one spatial location. Such a competition, however, leads to the suppression of multiple peak responses that encode different motions, as only the strongest response tends to survive. As a solution, we suggest a local center-surround competition for population-encoded motion directions and speeds. Similar motions are supported, and dissimilar ones are separated, by representing them as multiple activations, which occurs in the case of motion transparency. Psychophysical findings, such as motion attraction and repulsion for motion transparency displays, can be explained by this local competition. Besides this local competition mechanism, we show that feedback signals improve the processing of motion transparency. A discrimination task for transparent versus opaque motion is simulated, where motion transparency is generated by superimposing large field motion patterns of either varying size or varying coherence of motion. The model?s perceptual thresholds with and without feedback are calculated. We demonstrate that initially weak peak responses can be enhanced and stabilized through modulatory feedback signals from higher stages of processing.},

We devised a set of stimuli that differentiate between different possible computations. In particular, they distinguish between a velocity-space construction (such as intersection of constraints) and a linear computation such as vector averaging. In addition, these stimuli do not contain two-dimensional (2D) motion signals such as line intersections, that allow unambiguous determination of global velocity. Stimuli were presented in uncrossed disparity relative to the aperture through which they were presented, to reduce the effect of line terminator motion. We found that subjects are unable to detect the veridical global direction of motion for these stimuli. Instead, they perceive the stimulus pattern to be moving in a direction which reflects the average of its 1D motion components.

	abstract = {Why and how one should study a scale-space is prescribed by the universal physical law of scale invariance, expressed by the so-called Pi-theorem. The fact that any image is a physical observable with an inner and outer scale bound, necessarily gives rise to a ‘scale-space representation', in which a given image is represented by a one-dimensional family of images representing that image on various levels of inner spatial scale. An early vision system is completely ignorant of the geometry of its input. Its primary task is to establish this geometry at any available scale. The absence of geometrical knowledge poses additional constraints on the construction of a scale-space, notably linearity, spatial shift invariance and isotropy, thereby defining a complete hierarchical family of scaled partial differential operators: the Gaussian kernel (the lowest order, resettling operator) and its linear partial derivatives. They enable local image analysis through the detection of local differential structure in a robust way, while at the same time capturing global features through the extra scale degree of freedom. In this paper we show why the operations of scaling and differentiation cannot be separated. This framework permits us to construct in a systematic way multiscale, cartesian differential invariants, i.e. true image descriptors that exhibit manifest invariance with respect to a change of cartesian coordinates. The scale-space operators closely resemble the receptive field profiles found in mammalian frontend visual systems.},

	abstract = {Over repeated viewings of motion along a quasi-random path, ability to reproduce that path from memory improves. To assess the role of expectations and sequence context on such learning, subjects eye movements were measured while trajectories were viewed for subsequent reproduction. As a sequence of motions was repeated, subjects' eye movements became anticipatory, leading the stimulus' motions. To investigate how prediction errors affected eye movements and imitation learning, we injected an occasional deviant motion into a well-learned stimulus sequence, violating subjects' expectation about the motion that would be seen. This unexpected direction of motion in the stimulus sequence did not impair reproduction of the sequence. The externally induced prediction errors promoted one-shot learning: During the very next stimulus presentation, their eye movements showed that subjects now expected the new sequence item to reappear. A second experiment showed that an associative mismatch can facilitate accurate reproduction of an unexpected stimulus. After a deviant sequence item was presented, imitation accuracy for sequences that contained the deviant direction of motion was reduced relative to sequences that restored the original direction of motions. These findings demonstrate that in the context of a familiar sequence, unexpected events can play an important role in learning the sequence.},

	abstract = {Humans stand out from other animals in that they are able to explicitly report on the reliability of their internal operations. This ability, which is known as metacognition, is typically studied by asking people to report their confidence in the correctness of some decision. However, the computations underlying confidence reports remain unclear. In this paper, we present a fully Bayesian method for directly comparing models of confidence. Using a visual two-interval forced-choice task, we tested whether confidence reports reflect heuristic computations (e.g. the magnitude of sensory data) or Bayes optimal ones (i.e. how likely a decision is to be correct given the sensory data). In a standard design in which subjects were first asked to make a decision, and only then gave their confidence, subjects were mostly Bayes optimal. In contrast, in a less-commonly used design in which subjects indicated their confidence and decision simultaneously, they were roughly equally likely to use the Bayes optimal strategy or to use a heuristic but suboptimal strategy. Our results suggest that, while people's confidence reports can reflect Bayes optimal computations, even a small unusual twist or additional element of complexity can prevent optimality.},

We hypothesized that a deficit in motion processing is associated with eye-tracking dysfunction because both motion signals and the brain regions responsible for processing motion signals are implicated in the generation of smooth pursuit. We examined several aspects of visual perception, including motion perception, in patients with schizophrenia. {METHODS}: To evaluate motion perception, contrast sensitivity for velocity discrimination was measured in patients with schizophrenia (n=15) and normal control subjects (n=18). Contrast sensitivities for orientation discrimination and contrast detection were measured as control tasks. {RESULTS}: Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly lower contrast sensitivity (ie, higher thresholds) than normal controls for the discrimination of small velocity differences (eg, 11 vs 9 degrees/s). This reduction in contrast sensitivity was severe (up to 10-fold) in about 40\% of the patients. No group differences were found on the other tasks. {CONCLUSION}: The discrimination of small velocity differences is impaired in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia.},

Behavioural and computational studies of perceptual and higher cognitive functions that depend on these processes are outlined, and evidence that those functions and their neuronal mechanisms are impaired in schizophrenia is summarized. Finally, we compare and assess the long-term biological functions of contextual modulation at the level of computational theory as formalized by the theories of coherent infomax and free energy reduction. We conclude that those theories, together with the many empirical findings reviewed, show how contextual modulation at the neuronal level enables the cortex to flexibly adapt the use of its knowledge to current circumstances by amplifying and grouping relevant activities and by suppressing irrelevant activities.},

Compared to the anaesthetized animal, we show that magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with significantly higher firing rates. This increase in responsiveness is not accompanied by a change in the shape of neuronal contrast response functions or the strength of centre–surround antagonism; however, it is accompanied by an increased ability of neurons to follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies.},

We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

	abstract = {To probe how the brain integrates visual motion signals to guide behavior, we analyzed the smooth pursuit eye movements evoked by target motion with a stochastic component. When each dot of a texture executed an independent random walk such that speed or direction varied across the spatial extent of the target, pursuit variance increased as a function of the variance of visual pattern motion. Noise in either target direction or speed increased the variance of both eye speed and direction, implying a common neural noise source for estimating target speed and direction. Spatial averaging was inefficient for targets with {\textgreater}20 dots. Together these data suggest that pursuit performance is limited by the properties of spatial averaging across a noisy population of sensory neurons rather than across the physical stimulus. When targets executed a spatially uniform random walk in time around a central direction of motion, an optimized linear filter that describes the transformation of target motion into eye motion accounted for approximately 50\% of the variance in pursuit. Filters had widths of approximately 25 ms, much longer than the impulse response of the eye, and filter shape depended on both the range and correlation time of motion signals, suggesting that filters were products of sensory processing. By quantifying the effects of different levels of stimulus noise on pursuit, we have provided rigorous constraints for understanding sensory population decoding. We have shown how temporal and spatial integration of sensory signals converts noisy population responses into precise motor responses.},

	abstract = {Due to the aperture problem, the initial direction of tracking responses to a translating tilted bar is biased towards the direction orthogonal to the orientation of the bar. This directional error is largely reduced over the first 200 ms of tracking, consistent with the neural solution of the aperture problem (Pack \& Born, 2001) and is fully corrected during the steady-state. We have proposed that pursuit dynamics reflects that of visual motion processing and can be modeled as a dynamical Bayesian inference of 2D target motion (Bogadhi et al., 2010). Such simple paradigm also offers a powerful way to explore interactions between sensory and predictive signals in controlling action (Montagnini et al., 2006). We conducted two experiments to investigate these interactions by transiently blanking the target at different moments of pursuit. First, a 45$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ or 135$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ tilted bar translating horizontally was blanked for four different durations (0, 200, 400 and 800 ms) during steady-state tracking. Bar orientation after reappearance changed on half of the trials. We found a marginal directional bias (compared to initial bias) when the target reappeared with no change of orientation and when target changed orientation with no transient blanking. However, there was a significant directional bias when the target reappeared with a change in orientation. Second, the target (an upright or a 45$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ tilted line) was blanked (duration: 200 ms) on half of the trials during the initiation phase of pursuit, starting at either 100 or 180 ms after pursuit onset. Line orientation was constant. We found a significant directional bias (i.e. equal to the initial bias) when 45$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ tilted line reappeared after a 200 ms blank starting at 100 ms. Such bias was marginal when the target reappeared after a 200 ms blank starting at 180 ms. These results suggest for a conditionally weighted mixing of retinal and extra retina signals in driving smooth pursuit.},

	abstract = {Visual saliency is the perceptual quality that makes some items in visual scenes stand out from their immediate contexts. Visual saliency plays important roles in natural vision in that saliency can direct eye movements, deploy attention, and facilitate tasks like object detection and scene understanding. A central unsolved issue is: What features should be encoded in the early visual cortex for detecting salient features in natural scenes? To explore this important issue, we propose a hypothesis that visual saliency is based on efficient encoding of the probability distributions ({PDs}) of visual variables in specific contexts in natural scenes, referred to as context-mediated {PDs} in natural scenes. In this concept, computational units in the model of the early visual system do not act as feature detectors but rather as estimators of the context-mediated {PDs} of a full range of visual variables in natural scenes, which directly give rise to a measure of visual saliency of any input stimulus. To test this hypothesis, we developed a model of the context-mediated {PDs} in natural scenes using a modified algorithm for independent component analysis ({ICA}) and derived a measure of visual saliency based on these {PDs} estimated from a set of natural scenes. We demonstrated that visual saliency based on the context-mediated {PDs} in natural scenes effectively predicts human gaze in free-viewing of both static and dynamic natural scenes. This study suggests that the computation based on the context-mediated {PDs} of visual variables in natural scenes may underlie the neural mechanism in the early visual cortex for detecting salient features in natural scenes.},

Behavioral conditions in turn are accompanied by stereotypic spectral content of the {EEG}. In the rodent somatosensory system, the receptive field size of the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus ({VPM}) shrinks when anesthesia is deepened. Here we examined whether evoked thalamic responses are correlated with global {EEG} activity on a fine time scale of a few seconds. Trial-by-trial analysis of responses of {VPM} cells to whisker stimulation in lightly anesthetized rats indicated that increased {EEG} power in the delta band (1–4 Hz) was accompanied by a small, but highly significant, reduction in spontaneous and evoked thalamic firing. The opposite effect was found for the gamma {EEG} band (30–50 Hz). These significant correlations were not accompanied by an apparent change in the size of the receptive fields and were not {EEG} phase-related. The correlation between {EEG} and firing rate was observed only in neurons that responded to multiple whiskers and was higher for the non-principal whiskers. Importantly, the contributions of the two {EEG} bands to the modulation of {VPM} responses were to a large extent independent of each other. Our findings suggest that information conveyed by different whiskers can be rapidly modulated according to the global brain activity.},

We found that experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory neurons but had the opposite effect on maximum responses of putative inhibitory neurons, an observation that helps to reconcile contradictory reports regarding the presence and direction of this effect. In addition, we found that experience reduced the average stimulus-evoked response in both cell classes, but this decrease was much more pronounced in putative inhibitory units. This latter finding supports a potentially critical role of inhibitory neurons in detecting and initiating the cascade of events underlying adult neural plasticity in {ITC}. âº We explored effects of long-term experience on distinct cell classes in {IT} cortex âº Experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory cells âº Experience decreased maximum responses of putative inhibitory cells âº Experience decreased average responses of both cell classes but more so in inhibitory},

	abstract = {Because smooth-pursuit eye movements ({SPEM}) can be executed only in the presence of a moving target, it has been difficult to attribute the neuronal activity observed during the execution of these eye movements to either sensory processing or to motor preparation or execution. Previously, we showed that rhesus monkeys can be trained to perform {SPEM} directed toward an "imaginary" target defined by visual cues confined to the periphery of the visual field. The pursuit of an "imaginary" target provides the opportunity to elicit {SPEM} without stimulating visual receptive fields confined to the center of the visual field. Here, we report that a subset of neurons [85 "imaginary" visual tracking ({iVT})-neurons] in area {MST} of 3 rhesus monkeys were identically activated during pursuit of a conventional, foveal dot target and the "imaginary" target. Because {iVT}-neurons did not respond to the presentation of a moving "imaginary" target during fixation of a stationary dot, we are able to exclude that responses to pursuit of the "imaginary" target were artifacts of stimulation of the visual field periphery. Neurons recorded from the representation of the central parts of the visual field in neighboring area {MT}, usually vigorously discharging during pursuit of foveal targets, in no case responded to pursuit of the "imaginary" target. This dissociation between {MT} and {MST} neurons supports the view that pursuit responses of {MT} neurons are the result of target image motion, whereas those of {iVT}-neurons in area {MST} reflect an eye movement-related signal that is nonretinal in origin. {iVT}-neurons fell into two groups, depending on the properties of the eye movement-related signal. Whereas most of them (71\%) encoded eye velocity, a minority showed responses determined by eye position, irrespective of whether eye position was changed by smooth pursuit or by saccades. Only the former group exhibited responses that led the eye movement, which is a prerequisite for a causal role in the generation of {SPEM}.},

	abstract = {Our perceptions are fundamentally altered by our knowledge of the world. When cloud-gazing, for example, we tend spontaneously to recognize known objects in the random configurations of evaporated moisture. How our brains acquire such knowledge and how it impacts our perceptions is a matter of heated discussion. A topic of recent debate has concerned the hypothesis that our visual system 'assumes' that objects are static or move slowly [1] rather than more quickly [1] , [2] and [3] . This hypothesis, or 'prior on slow speeds', was postulated because it could elegantly explain a number of perceptual biases observed in situations of uncertainty [2]. Interestingly, those biases affect not only the perception of speed, but also the direction of motion. For example, the direction of a line whose endpoints are hidden (as in the 'aperture problem') or poorly visible (for example, at low contrast or for short presentations) is more often perceived as being perpendicular to the line than it really is — an illusion consistent with expecting that the line moves more slowly than it really does. How this 'prior on slow speeds' is shaped by experience and whether it remains malleable in adults is unclear. Here, we show that systematic exposure to high-speed stimuli can lead to a reversal of this direction illusion. This suggests that the shaping of the brain's prior expectations of even the most basic properties of the environment is a continuous process.},

In the natural world, a moving object may differ from occluders by many characteristics (colour, depth, shape and so on). Scene segmentation based on these characteristics is thought to happen early in visual processing, and to influence how objects, including moving objects, are identified. What happens if the only characteristic distinguishing an object is its direction of motion? Experiments with random dot displays show that one dot moving in a constant trajectory is readily detected among identical dots in brownian motion. Detection declines sharply if the trajectory is intermittently broken, but improves if occluders obscure the breaks in the trajectory. It is not sufficient that these occluders be perceived as segmented from the rest of the display (such as by colour or depth). Rather, it is critical that the occluders do not contain motion that is similar in direction to that of the target trajectory. We conclude that detection of the trajectory is due to the integration of information within a network of low-level motion detectors and is not dependent on segmentation processes.},

	abstract = {The review presents the evidence from experimental neuroscience on perceptual inference. It starts with a review of the theories of visual perception. It lays out the tenets of perceptual inference, a basic scheme and some predictions. Perceptual inference refers to the ability to infer sensory stimuli from predictions that result from internal neural representations built through prior experience. Methods of Bayesian statistical inference and decision theory model cognition adequately by using error sensing either in guiding action or in ” generative” models that predict the sensory information. In this framework, perception can be seen as a process qualitatively distinct from sensation, a process of information evaluation using previously acquired and stored representations (memories) that is guided by sensory feedback. The stored representations can be utilised as internal models of sensory stimuli enabling long term associations, for example in operant conditioning. Evidence for perceptual inference is contributed by such phenomena as the cortical co-localisation of object perception with object memory, the response invariance in the responses of some neurons to variations in the stimulus, as well as from situations in which perception can be dissociated from sensation. In the context of perceptual inference, sensory areas of the cerebral cortex that have been facilitated by a priming signal may be regarded as comparators in a closed feedback loop, similar to the better known motor reflexes in the sensorimotor system. The adult cerebral cortex can be regarded as similar to a servomechanism, in using sensory feedback to correct internal models, producing predictions of the outside world on the basis of past experience.},

	abstract = {Costs (e.g. energetic expenditure) and benefits (e.g. food) are central determinants of behavior. In ecology and economics, they are combined to form a utility function which is maximized to guide choices. This principle is widely used in neuroscience as a normative model of decision and action, but current versions of this model fail to consider how decisions are actually converted into actions (i.e. the formation of trajectories). Here, we describe an approach where decision making and motor control are optimal, iterative processes derived from the maximization of the discounted, weighted difference between expected rewards and foreseeable motor efforts. The model accounts for decision making in cost/benefit situations, and detailed characteristics of control and goal tracking in realistic motor tasks. As a normative construction, the model is relevant to address the neural bases and pathological aspects of decision making and motor control. Behavior is made of decisions and actions. The decisions are based on the costs and benefits of potential actions, and the chosen actions are executed through the proper control of body segments. The corresponding processes are generally considered in separate theories of decision making and motor control, which cannot explain how the actual costs and benefits of a chosen action can be consistent with the expected costs and benefits involved at the decision stage. Here, we propose an overarching optimal model of decision and motor control based on the maximization of a mixed function of costs and benefits. The model provides a unified account of decision in cost/benefit situations (e.g. choice between small reward/low effort and large reward/high effort options), and motor control in realistic motor tasks. The model appears suitable to advance our understanding of the neural bases and pathological aspects of decision making and motor control.},

One of the best-studied sensory ambiguities is found in visual processing, and arises because of the inherent uncertainty in detecting the motion direction of an untextured contour moving within a small aperture. A similar sensory ambiguity arises in identifying the actual motion associated with linear accelerations sensed by the otolith organs in the inner ear. These internal linear accelerometers respond identically during translational motion (for example, running forward) and gravitational accelerations experienced as we reorient the head relative to gravity (that is, head tilt). Using new stimulus combinations, we identify here cerebellar and brainstem motion-sensitive neurons that compute a solution to the inertial motion detection problem. We show that the firing rates of these populations of neurons reflect the computations necessary to construct an internal model representation of the physical equations of motion.},

When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm {DNA} from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed {CpG} hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes.

We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31\% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40\%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40\%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10\% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

	abstract = {The receptive fields of complex cells in the early visual cortex are economically modeled by combining outputs of a quadrature pair of linear filters. For actual complex cells, such a minimal model may be insufficient because many more simple cells are thought to make up a complex cell receptive field. To examine the minimalist model physiologically, we analyzed spatial relationships between the internal structure (subunits) and the overall receptive fields of individual complex cells by a two-stimulus interaction technique. The receptive fields of complex cells are more circular and only slightly larger than their subunits in size. In addition, complex cell subunits occupy spatial extents similar to those of simple cell receptive fields. Therefore in these respects, the minimalist schema is a fair approximation to actual complex cells. However, there are violations against the minimal model. Simple cell receptive fields have significantly fewer subregions than complex cell subunits and, in general, simple cell receptive fields are elongated more horizontally than vertically. This bias is absent in complex cell subunits and receptive fields. Thus simple cells cannot be equated to individual complex cell subunits and spatial pooling of simple cells may occur anisotropically to constitute a complex cell subunit. Moreover, when linear filters for complex cell subunits are examined separately for bright and dark responses, there are significant imbalances and position displacements between them. This suggests that actual complex cell receptive fields are constructed by a richer combination of linear filters than proposed by the minimalist model.},

	abstract = {One of the most common causes of blindness is a disorder called retinitis pigmentosa. In a healthy eye, the surface at the back of the eye – called the retina – contains cells called photoreceptors that detect light and convert it into electrical signals for the brain to process. In people with retinitis pigmentosa, these photoreceptor cells die off gradually, which leads to loss of vision. The only treatment available for retinitis pigmentosa is to have an artificial retina implanted into the eye. The artificial retina consists of an array of tiny electrodes, which take over from the damaged photoreceptors and generate electrical signals. The person with the implant perceives these electrical signals as bright flashes called “phosphenes”. However, the phosphenes are too large and imprecise to provide the person with vision that is good enough for tasks such as walking unaided or reading. To find out why artificial retinas produce such poor resolution, Roux et al. compared how a rat's brain responds to either natural visual stimuli or activation of implanted an array of micro-electrodes. Both the micro-electrodes and the natural stimuli activated the same areas of the brain. However, the micro-electrodes produced larger and more elongated patterns of activation. This is because the electrical currents generated by the micro-electrodes diffused throughout the retinal tissue and activated other neurons besides those intended. To overcome this problem, Roux et al. tested different ways of stimulating the micro-electrodes in order to identify those that induce the desired patterns of brain activity. This approach – known as reverse engineering – did indeed improve the performance of the micro-electrode array. The next step is to extend these findings, which were obtained in healthy rats, to non-human primates or animal models of retinitis pigmentosa to better understand the condition in humans. In addition, combining the current approach with other existing techniques should further improve the vision that can be achieved with artificial retinas.},

Each cortical layer is thought to transform sensory signals to extract behaviorally relevant information. Now, Constantinople and Bruno (p. 1591) challenge this dogma. In vivo whole-cell recordings revealed that sensory stimuli activate neurons in deep cortical layers simultaneously to those in layer 4 and that a large number of thalamic neurons converge onto deep pyramidal neurons, possibly allowing sensory information to completely bypass upper layers. Temporary blockade of layer 4 revealed that synaptic input to deep cortical layers derived entirely from the thalamus and not at all from upper cortical layers. This thalamically derived synaptic input reliably drove pyramidal neurons in layer 5 to discharge action potentials in the living animal. These deep layer neurons project to numerous higher-order brain regions and could directly mediate behavior.},

Our model does not employ numerical relaxation or other explicit minimization, but instead relies on the fact that the probability that a particle following a random walk will pass through a given position and orientation on a path joining two boundary fragments can be computed directly as the product of two vector-field convolutions. We show that for the random walk we define, the maximum likelihood paths are curves of least energy, that is, on average, random walks follow paths commonly assumed to model the shape of illusory contours. A computer model is demonstrated on numerous illusory contour stimuli from the literature.},

However, the {LCA} lacks analysis of its convergence properties, and previous results on neural networks for nonsmooth optimization do not apply to the specifics of the {LCA} architecture. We show that the {LCA} has desirable convergence properties, such as stability and global convergence to the optimum of the objective function when it is unique. Under some mild conditions, the support of the solution is also proven to be reached in finite time. Furthermore, some restrictions on the problem specifics allow us to characterize the convergence rate of the system by showing that the {LCA} converges exponentially fast with an analytically bounded convergence rate.

This holds even when such patterns are embedded in equally dense random spiking activity, that is, in the absence of external reference times such as a stimulus onset. Here we demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that {STDP} can also learn repeating rate-modulated patterns, which have received more experimental evidence, for example, through post-stimulus time histograms ({PSTHs}). Each input spike train is generated from a rate function using a stochastic sampling mechanism, chosen to be an inhomogeneous Poisson process here. Learning is feasible provided significant covarying rate modulations occur within the typical timescale of {STDP} (\${\textbackslash}sim\$10-20 ms) for sufficiently many inputs (\${\textbackslash}sim\$100 among 1000 in our simulations), a condition that is met by many experimental {PSTHs}. Repeated pattern presentations induce spike-time correlations that are captured by {STDP}. Despite imprecise input spike times and even variable spike counts, a single trained neuron robustly detects the pattern just a few milliseconds after its presentation. Therefore, temporal imprecision and Poisson-like firing variability are not an obstacle to fast temporal coding. {STDP} provides an appealing mechanism to learn such rate patterns, which, beyond sensory processing, may also be involved in many cognitive tasks.},

Human subjects can respond in under 400 ms, and event-related-potential studies have shown that the underlying processing can be done in less than 150 ms. Monkeys trained to perform the same task have proved even faster. However, most of these experiments have only been done with biologically relevant target categories such as animals or food. Here we performed the same study on human subjects, alternating between a task in which the target category was 'animal', and a task in which the target category was 'means of transport'. These natural images of clearly artificial objects contained targets as varied as cars, trucks, trains, boats, aircraft, and hot-air balloons. However, the subjects performed almost identically in both tasks, with reaction times not significantly longer in the 'means of transport' task. These reaction times were much shorter than in any previous study on natural-image processing. We conclude that, at least for these two superordinate categories, the speed of ultra-rapid visual categorisation of natural scenes does not depend on the target category, and that this processing could rely primarily on feed-forward, automatic mechanisms.},

	abstract = {In this paper we introduce the idea of explaining responses, in one cortical area, in terms of an interaction between the influence of another area and some experimental (sensory or task-related) parameter. We refer to these effects as psychophysiological interactions and relate them to interactions based solely on experimental factors (i.e., psychological interactions), in factorial designs, and interactions among neurophysiological measurements (i.e., physiological interactions). We have framed psychophysiological interactions in terms of functional integration by noting that the degree to which the activity in one area can be predicted, on the basis of activity in another, corresponds to the contribution of the second to the first, where this contribution can be related to effective connectivity. A psychophysiological interaction means that the contribution of one area to another changes significantly with the experimental or psychological context. Alternatively these interactions can be thought of as a contribution-dependent change in regional responses to an experimental or psychological factor. In other words the contribution can be thought of as modulating the responses elicited by a particular stimulus or psychological process. The potential importance of this approach lies in (i) conferring a degree of functional specificity on this aspect of effective connectivity and (ii) providing a model of modulation, where the contribution from a distal area can be considered to modulate responses to the psychological or stimulus-specific factor defining the interaction. Although distinct in neurobiological terms, these are equivalent perspectives on the same underlying interaction. We illustrate these points using a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of attention to visual motion and a position emission tomography study of visual priming. We focus on interactions among extrastriate, inferotemporal, and posterior parietal regions during visual processing, under different attentional and perceptual conditions.},

	abstract = {The activity of cortical neurons is determined by the input they receive from presynaptic neurons. Many previous studies have investigated how specific aspects of the statistics of the input affect the spike trains of single neurons and neurons in recurrent networks. However, typically very simple random network models are considered in such studies. Here we use a recently developed algorithm to construct networks based on a quasi-fractal probability measure which are much more variable than commonly used network models, and which therefore promise to sample the space of recurrent networks in a more exhaustive fashion than previously possible. We use the generated graphs as the underlying network topology in simulations of networks of integrate-and-fire neurons in an asynchronous and irregular state. Based on an extensive dataset of networks and neuronal simulations we assess statistical relations between features of the network structure and the spiking activity. Our results highlight the strong influence that some details of the network structure have on the activity dynamics of both single neurons and populations, even if some global network parameters are kept fixed. We observe specific and consistent relations between activity characteristics like spike-train irregularity or correlations and network properties, for example the distributions of the numbers of in- and outgoing connections or clustering. Exploiting these relations, we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate structural characteristics of the network from activity data. We also assess higher order correlations of spiking activity in the various networks considered here, and find that their occurrence strongly depends on the network structure. These results provide directions for further theoretical studies on recurrent networks, as well as new ways to interpret spike train recordings from neural circuits.},

We explored the effects of these implementation details. The exploration allowed for more effective implementation of the algorithms. The enhanced implementations are better suited to be used in production. The human brain is a complex biological neural network characterised by high degrees of connectivity among neurons. Any system designed to simulate large-scale spiking neuronal networks needs to support such connectivity and the associated communication traffic in the form of spike events. This paper investigates how best to generate multicast routes for {SpiNNaker}, a purpose-built, low-power, massively-parallel architecture. The discussed algorithms are an essential ingredient for the efficient operation of {SpiNNaker} since generating multicast routes is known to be an {NP}-complete problem. In fact, multicast communications have been extensively studied in the literature, but we found no existing algorithm adaptable to {SpiNNaker}. The proposed algorithms exploit the regularity of the two-dimensional triangular torus topology and the availability of selective multicast at hardware level. A comprehensive study of the parameters of the algorithms and their effectiveness is carried out in this paper considering different destination distributions ranging from worst-case to a real neural application. The results show that two novel proposed algorithms can reduce significantly the pressure exerted onto the interconnection infrastructure while remaining effective to be used in a production environment.},

	abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of using dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}) to estimate the coupling parameters (effective connectivity) of large models with many regions. This is a potentially important problem because meaningful graph theoretic analyses of effective connectivity rest upon the statistics of the connections (edges). This calls for characterisations of networks with an appreciable number of regions (nodes). The problem here is that the number of coupling parameters grows quadratically with the number of nodes—leading to severe conditional dependencies among their estimates and a computational load that quickly becomes unsustainable. Here, we describe a simple solution, in which we use functional connectivity to provide prior constraints that bound the effective number of free parameters. In brief, we assume that priors over connections between individual nodes can be replaced by priors over connections between modes (patterns over nodes). By using a small number of modes, we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem in an informed way. The modes we use are the principal components or eigenvectors of the functional connectivity matrix. However, this approach begs the question of how many modes to use. This question can be addressed using Bayesian model comparison to optimise the number of modes. We imagine that this form of prior – over the extrinsic (endogenous) connections in large {DCMs} – may be useful for people interested in applying graph theory to distributed networks in the brain or to characterise connectivity beyond the subgraphs normally examined in {DCM}. âº Here we investigate the possibility to invert large {DCMs} with many regions. âº To do that, we place constraints on priors to bind the number of free parameters. âº Constraints are provided by the principal modes of the functional connectivity. âº Bayesian model comparison is used to identify the optimal number of modes. âº The ability to invert large {DCMs} provides a new opportunity for graph theory users.},

Current approaches have followed a general inference paradigm where a parametric probability model is often used to characterize the temporal evolution of the underlying stochastic processes. To directly capture the overall variability and distribution in the space of the spike trains, we focus on a data-driven approach where statistics are defined and computed in the function space in which spike trains are viewed as individual points. To this end, we at first develop a parametrized family of metrics that takes into account different warpings in the time domain and generalizes several currently used spike train distances. These new metrics are essentially penalized L p norms, involving appropriate functions of spike trains, with penalties associated with time-warping. The notions of means and variances of spike trains are then defined based on the new metrics when p = 2 (corresponding to the ” Euclidean distance”). Using some restrictive conditions, we present an efficient recursive algorithm, termed Matching-Minimization algorithm, to compute the sample mean of a set of spike trains with arbitrary numbers of spikes. The proposed metrics as well as the mean spike trains are demonstrated using simulations as well as an experimental recording from the motor cortex. It is found that all these methods achieve desirable performance and the results support the success of this novel framework.},

In V2, no ocular dominance organization was seen, while regions of poor orientation tuning colocalized to every other cytochrome oxidase stripe.

	abstract = {Coarse codes are widely used throughout the brain to encode sensory and motor variables. Methods designed to interpret these codes, such as population vector analysis, are either inefficient (the variance of the estimate is much larger than the smallest possible variance) or biologically implausible, like maximum likelihood. Moreover, these methods attempt to compute a scalar or vector estimate of the encoded variable. Neurons are faced with a similar estimation problem. They must read out the responses of the presynaptic neurons, but, by contrast, they typically encode the variable with a further population code rather than as a scalar. We show how a nonlinear recurrent network can be used to perform estimation in a near-optimal way while keeping the estimate in a coarse code format. This work suggests that lateral connections in the cortex may be involved in cleaning up uncorrelated noise among neurons representing similar variables.},

We account for physiological data obtained by voltage-sensitive dye ({VSD}) imaging which reports mesoscopic population activity at high spatio-temporal resolution. Stimulation included a single flashed square, a single flashed bar, the line-motion paradigm â€ ” for which psychophysical studies showed that flashing a square briefly before a bar produces sensation of illusory motion within the bar â€ ” and moving squares controls. We consider a two-layer neural field ({NF}) model describing an excitatory and an inhibitory layer of neurons as a coupled system of non-linear integro-differential equations. Under the assumption that the aggregated activity of both layers is reflected by {VSD} imaging, our phenomenological model quantitatively accounts for the observed spatio-temporal activity patterns. Moreover, the model generalizes to novel similar stimuli as it matches activity evoked by moving squares of different speeds. Our results indicate that feedback from higher brain areas is not required to produce motion patterns in the case of the illusory line-motion paradigm. Physiological interpretation of the model suggests that a considerable fraction of the {VSD} signal may be due to inhibitory activity, supporting the notion that balanced intra-layer cortical interactions between inhibitory and excitatory populations play a major role in shaping dynamic stimulus representations in the early visual cortex.},

Channel decorrelation by adaptive mechanisms results in efficient coding, whereas pattern decorrelation facilitates the readout and storage of information. Mechanisms achieving pattern decorrelation, however, remain unclear. We developed a theoretical framework that relates high-dimensional pattern decorrelation to neuronal and circuit properties in a mathematically stringent fashion. For a generic class of random neuronal networks, we proved that pattern decorrelation emerges from neuronal nonlinearities and is amplified by recurrent connectivity. This mechanism does not require adaptation of the network, is enhanced by sparse connectivity, depends on the baseline membrane potential and is robust. Connectivity measurements and computational modeling suggest that this mechanism is involved in pattern decorrelation in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. These results reveal a generic relationship between the structure and function of neuronal circuits that is probably relevant for pattern processing in various brain areas.},

We examined the effect of cone noise on visual signals by measuring its contribution to correlated noise in primate retinal ganglion cells. Correlated noise was strong in the responses of dissimilar cell types with shared cone inputs. The dynamics of cone noise could account for rapid correlations in ganglion cell activity, and the extent of shared cone input could explain correlation strength. Furthermore, correlated noise limited the fidelity with which visual signals were encoded by populations of ganglion cells. Thus, a simple picture emerges: cone noise, traversing the retina through diverse pathways, accounts for most of the noise and correlations in the retinal output and constrains how higher centers exploit signals carried by parallel visual pathways.},

A variable road sign was added on the scene to manipulate expectations about target identity. We then analyzed the timing and amplitude of the deviation of mouse trajectories toward the incorrect response and, using an eye tracker, the detection time (before fixating the target) and the identification time (fixations on the target). Results revealed that expectation of the correct target results in earlier decisions with less deviation toward the alternative response, this effect being partially explained by the facilitation of target identification.},

Using a realistic model of the insect antennal lobe we examined two competing components of this process -lateral excitation from local excitatory interneurons, and slow inhibition from local inhibitory interneurons. We found that lateral excitation amplified differences between representations of similar odors by recruiting projection neurons that did not receive direct input from olfactory receptors. However, this increased sensitivity also amplified noisy variations in input and compromised the ability of the system to respond reliably to multiple presentations of the same odor. Slow inhibition curtailed the spread of projection neuron activity and increased response reliability. These competing influences must be finely balanced in order to decorrelate odor representations.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that networks of spiking neurons with noise can emulate simple forms of probabilistic inference through ” neural sampling”, i.e., by treating spikes as samples from a probability distribution of network states that is encoded in the network. Deficiencies of the existing model are its reliance on single neurons for sampling from each random variable, and the resulting limitation in representing quickly varying probabilistic information. We show that both deficiencies can be overcome by moving to a biologically more realistic encoding of each salient random variable through the stochastic firing activity of an ensemble of neurons. The resulting model demonstrates that networks of spiking neurons with noise can easily track and carry out basic computational operations on rapidly varying probability distributions, such as the odds of getting rewarded for a specific behavior. We demonstrate the viability of this new approach towards neural coding and computation, which makes use of the inherent parallelism of generic neural circuits, by showing that this model can explain experimentally observed firing activity of cortical neurons for a variety of tasks that require rapid temporal integration of sensory information. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) approach to probabilistic inference for a distribution is to draw a sequence of samples from and to carry out computational operations via simple online computations on such a sequence. But such a sequential computational process takes time, and therefore this simple version of the {MCMC} approach runs into problems when one needs to carry out probabilistic inference for rapidly varying distributions. This difficulty also affects all currently existing models for emulating {MCMC} sampling by networks of stochastically firing neurons. We show here that by moving to a space-rate approach where salient probabilities are encoded through the spiking activity of ensembles of neurons, rather than by single neurons, this problem can be solved. In this way even theoretically optimal models for dealing with time varying distributions through sequential Monte Carlo sampling, so called particle filters, can be emulated by networks of spiking neurons. Each spike of a neuron in an ensemble represents in this approach a ” particle” (or vote) for a particular value of a time-varying random variable. In other words, neural circuits can speed up computations based on Monte Carlo sampling through their inherent parallelism.},

	abstract = {We consider the comparative study of visual process integration within either a biological system (i.e. the parieto-ventral and parieto-dorsal pathways of the cortical visual system in the primate) or an artificial system. Both systems deliver an estimation of [where], that is to say the motion and structure of the observed scene and of [what], i.e. the perceptual grouping and labeling of objects in the scene. The long term goal is to elaborate a common theory about precise questions in both neurosciences and algorithms and their architecture in artificial vision, including computer vision applications. Within this framework, the function and behavior of adaptive feedback mechanisms is a key point and on the leading edge of biological studies. The core of this idea is that visual processing is build around: 1) a first computational step allowing to pre-process the input information, provide initial estimates, generate hypotheses about which models to use, ? 2) a refinement step using iterative mechanisms of optimization of the visual perception. Such mechanisms occur, sometimes implicitly, in artificial vision processes. They are mainly related to such problems as the combination of visual attributes, computed from different sources and then fused for “what” and “where” perceptual tasks; the use of a-priori information, obtained from higher-level visual modules. These modules define models estimated from the data. These models are either given a-priori (e.g. rigidity, shape regularity, ..) or chosen thanks to object labeling obtained during the first computational step. The present work is a theoretical study in three steps: (a) a systematic analysis of existing results in neuro-science, (b) an interpretation of these results from the viewpoint of the variational approach widely used in computer vision (c) a specification of a simulation tool of parts of the visual cortex.},

	abstract = {The neurophysiology of eye movements has been studied extensively, and several computational models have been proposed for decision-making processes that underlie the generation of eye movements towards a visual stimulus in a situation of uncertainty. One class of models, known as linear rise-to-threshold models, provides an economical, yet broadly applicable, explanation for the observed variability in the latency between the onset of a peripheral visual target and the saccade towards it. So far, however, these models do not account for the dynamics of learning across a sequence of stimuli, and they do not apply to situations in which subjects are exposed to events with conditional probabilities. In this methodological paper, we extend the class of linear rise-to-threshold models to address these limitations. Specifically, we reformulate previous models in terms of a generative, hierarchical model, by combining two separate sub-models that account for the interplay between learning of target locations across trials and the decision-making process within trials. We derive a maximum-likelihood scheme for parameter estimation as well as model comparison on the basis of log likelihood ratios. The utility of the integrated model is demonstrated by applying it to empirical saccade data acquired from three healthy subjects. Model comparison is used (i) to show that eye movements do not only reflect marginal but also conditional probabilities of target locations, and (ii) to reveal subject-specific learning profiles over trials. These individual learning profiles are sufficiently distinct that test samples can be successfully mapped onto the correct subject by a na??ve Bayes classifier. Altogether, our approach extends the class of linear rise-to-threshold models of saccadic decision making, overcomes some of their previous limitations, and enables statistical inference both about learning of target locations across trials and the decision-making process within trials. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To test this idea, we manipulated pairs of sensory cues in a bistable display consisting of two superimposed moving drifting gratings, and we asked subjects to report their perceived changes in depth ordering. We report that the fractions of dominance of each percept follow the multiplicative rule predicted by Bayesian sampling.

	abstract = {Traveling waves of neuronal oscillations have been observed in many cortical regions, including the motor and sensory cortex. Such waves are often modulated in a task-dependent fashion although their precise functional role remains a matter of debate. Here we conjecture that the cortex can utilize the direction and wavelength of traveling waves to encode information. We present a novel neural mechanism by which such information may be decoded by the spatial arrangement of receptors within the dendritic receptor field. In particular, we show how the density distributions of excitatory and inhibitory receptors can combine to act as a spatial filter of wave patterns. The proposed dendritic mechanism ensures that the neuron selectively responds to specific wave patterns, thus constituting a neural basis of pattern decoding. We validate this proposal in the descending motor system, where we model the large receptor fields of the pyramidal tract neurons — the principle outputs of the motor cortex — decoding motor commands encoded in the direction of traveling wave patterns in motor cortex. We use an existing model of field oscillations in motor cortex to investigate how the topology of the pyramidal cell receptor field acts to tune the cells responses to specific oscillatory wave patterns, even when those patterns are highly degraded. The model replicates key findings of the descending motor system during simple motor tasks, including variable interspike intervals and weak corticospinal coherence. By additionally showing how the nature of the wave patterns can be controlled by modulating the topology of local intra-cortical connections, we hence propose a novel integrated neuronal model of encoding and decoding motor commands. Physiological studies in humans and monkeys have revealed spatially organized waves of neuronal activity that propagate across the cortex during sensory or behavioral tasks. However the functional role of such waves remains elusive. In the present study, we use numerical simulation to investigate whether wave patterns may serve as a basis for neural coding in cortex. Specifically, we propose a theoretical dendritic mechanism which permits neurons to respond selectively to the morphological properties of waves. In this proposal, the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory receptors within the dendritic receptor field constitutes a spatial filter of the incoming wave patterns. The proposed mechanism allows the neuron to discriminate waves based on wavelength and orientation, thereby providing a basis for neural decoding. We explore this concept in the context of the descending motor system where the pyramidal tract neurons of motor cortex monosynaptically innervate motor neurons in the spinal cord. Pyramidal tract neurons have broad dendritic fields which make them ideal candidates for spatial filters of waves in motor cortex. Our model demonstrates how wave patterns in motor cortex can be transformed into a descending motor drive which replicates some fundamental oscillatory properties of human motor physiology.},

	abstract = {Throughout the central nervous system, the timescale over which pairs of neural spike trains are correlated is shaped by stimulus structure and behavioral context. Such shaping is thought to underlie important changes in the neural code, but the neural circuitry responsible is largely unknown. In this study, we investigate a stimulus-induced shaping of pairwise spike train correlations in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish. Simultaneous single unit recordings of principal electrosensory cells show that an increase in the spatial extent of stimuli increases correlations at short (≈ 10 ms) timescales while simultaneously reducing correlations at long (≈ 100 ms) timescales. A spiking network model of the first two stages of electrosensory processing replicates this correlation shaping, under the assumptions that spatially broad stimuli both saturate feedforward afferent input and recruit an open-loop inhibitory feedback pathway. Our model predictions are experimentally verified using both the natural heterogeneity of the electrosensory system and pharmacological blockade of descending feedback projections. For weak stimuli, linear response analysis of the spiking network shows that the reduction of long timescale correlation for spatially broad stimuli is similar to correlation cancellation mechanisms previously suggested to be operative in mammalian cortex. The mechanism for correlation shaping supports population-level filtering of irrelevant distractor stimuli, thereby enhancing the population response to relevant prey and conspecific communication inputs.},

	abstract = {To evaluate smooth-pursuit ({SP}) function in the primate frontal eye field ({FEF}), microinjections of muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid ({GABA}) agonist, were used to reversibly deactivate physiologically characterized sites in {FEF}. {SP} was severely impaired by deactivation at sites in the {FEF}'s smooth eye movement region ({FEFsem}) located in the fundus and posterior bank of the macaque monkey's arcuate sulcus. These {SP} deficits were apparent immediately after the muscimol injection and persisted for several hours but recovered by the next day. {SP} was most drastically and consistently impaired for directions similar to the injected site's elicited smooth eye movement direction or to the optimal {SP} direction for its neuronal responses. Targets moving in these directions, usually ipsilateral to the injected hemisphere, were tracked primarily with saccades after the muscimol injection, the peak {SP} velocity being only 10-30\% of preinjection velocity. {SP} in other directions, including contralateral, was less strongly affected. Initial {SP} acceleration in response to target motion onset was also significantly diminished, generally by approximately the same proportion as peak {SP} velocity. In contrast, saccades were largely unaffected by muscimol injections in {FEFsem}; nor was there an immediate effect on {SP} when control sites in the saccadic region of {FEF} ({FEFsac}) were deactivated, although a {SP} deficit often appeared 30-60 min after {FEFsac} injections, possibly reflecting diffusion of muscimol into neighboring {FEFsem}. These reversible {SP} deficits produced by muscimol inactivation within {FEFsem} are similar to permanent deficits caused by large aspiration lesions of {FEF} and indicate that inclusion of {FEFsem} is the critical factor determining whether {FEF} lesions impair {SP}. The severity of the reversible deficits found here indicates how extremely critical {FEFsem} is for normal highgain {SP}.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002521},
	abstract = {We present a new approach to modeling languages for computational biology, which we call the layer-oriented approach. The approach stems from the observation that many diverse biological phenomena are described using a small set of mathematical formalisms (e.g. differential equations), while at the same time different domains and subdomains of computational biology require that models are structured according to the accepted terminology and classification of that domain. Our approach uses distinct semantic layers to represent the domain-specific biological concepts and the underlying mathematical formalisms. Additional functionality can be transparently added to the language by adding more layers. This approach is specifically concerned with declarative languages, and throughout the paper we note some of the limitations inherent to declarative approaches. The layer-oriented approach is a way to specify explicitly how high-level biological modeling concepts are mapped to a computational representation, while abstracting away details of particular programming languages and simulation environments. To illustrate this process, we define an example language for describing models of ionic currents, and use a general mathematical notation for semantic transformations to show how to generate model simulation code for various simulation environments. We use the example language to describe a Purkinje neuron model and demonstrate how the layer-oriented approach can be used for solving several practical issues of computational neuroscience model development. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the approach in comparison with other modeling language efforts in the domain of computational biology and outline some principles for extensible, flexible modeling language design. We conclude by describing in detail the semantic transformations defined for our language. The pursuit for understanding of neural function by computational modeling has produced a variety of software tools, with each tool targeting specific audiences and often requiring input in its own distinct language. Consequently, comprehending and communicating neuroscience models is a difficult and time-consuming task. In this paper we suggest a new approach towards designing biological modeling languages, which we call the layer-oriented approach. The approach stems from the observation that diverse biological phenomena are described using a small set of mathematical formalisms (e.g. differential equations), which are structured according to some biological principles. Our proposal is illustrated by means of a computer language for describing computational models of ionic currents. The language consists of rules for expressing mathematical equations as well as rules to organize these equations according to the specific terminology used by neuroscientists. The layer-oriented approach offers two chief advantages. First, it allows the flexible use of mathematical equations to represent many different kinds of biological models. Second, it restricts the language within a framework of biological concepts so that existing modeling software can be reused. The goal of the layer-oriented approach is to help define appropriate notations for computational biology while enabling interoperability of software for biological modeling.},

We leverage this insight to address motor learning, by importing it into the setting of model-based reinforcement learning.

We propose a unified framework, applying the quick contrast sensitivity function ({qCSF}) method, which was recently developed for the rapid measurement of contrast sensitivity across the full spatial-frequency range (Lesmes, Lu, Baek, \& Albright, 2010), to measure both first- and second-order sensitivity functions. We first show that the {qCSF} methodology can be successfully adapted to different kinds of first- and second-order measurements. We provide a normative dataset for both first- and second-order sensitivity, and we show that the sensitivity to all these stimuli is equal in the two eyes. Our results confirm some strong differences between first- and second-order processing, in accordance with the classical filter-rectify-filter model. They suggest a common contrast detection mechanism but different second-order mechanisms.},

By combining all these elements, the decoder produces reconstructions that accurately reflect both the spatial structure and semantic category of the objects contained in the observed natural image. Our results show that prior information has a substantial effect on the quality of natural image reconstructions.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002836},
	abstract = {Accurate models of synaptic plasticity are essential to understand the adaptive properties of the nervous system and for realistic models of learning and memory. Experiments have shown that synaptic plasticity depends not only on pre- and post-synaptic activity patterns, but also on the strength of the connection itself. Namely, weaker synapses are more easily strengthened than already strong ones. This so called soft-bound plasticity automatically constrains the synaptic strengths. It is known that this has important consequences for the dynamics of plasticity and the synaptic weight distribution, but its impact on information storage is unknown. In this modeling study we introduce an information theoretic framework to analyse memory storage in an online learning setting. We show that soft-bound plasticity increases a variety of performance criteria by about 18\% over hard-bound plasticity, and likely maximizes the storage capacity of synapses. It is generally believed that our memories are stored in the synaptic connections between neurons. Numerous experimental studies have therefore examined when and how the synaptic connections change. In parallel, many computational studies have examined the properties of memory and synaptic plasticity, aiming to better understand human memory and allow for neural network models of the brain. However, the plasticity rules used in most studies are highly simplified and do not take into account the rich behaviour found in experiments. For instance, it has been observed in experiments that it is hard to make strong synapses even stronger. Here we show that this saturation of plasticity enhances the number of memories that can be stored and introduce a general framework to calculate information storage in online learning paradigms.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000538},
	abstract = {Due to noisy motor commands and imprecise and ambiguous sensory information, there is often substantial uncertainty about the relative location between our body and objects in the environment. Little is known about how well people manage and compensate for this uncertainty in purposive movement tasks like grasping. Grasping objects requires reach trajectories to generate object-fingers contacts that permit stable lifting. For objects with position uncertainty, some trajectories are more efficient than others in terms of the probability of producing stable grasps. We hypothesize that people attempt to generate efficient grasp trajectories that produce stable grasps at first contact without requiring post-contact adjustments. We tested this hypothesis by comparing human uncertainty compensation in grasping objects against optimal predictions. Participants grasped and lifted a cylindrical object with position uncertainty, introduced by moving the cylinder with a robotic arm over a sequence of 5 positions sampled from a strongly oriented 2D Gaussian distribution. Preceding each reach, vision of the object was removed for the remainder of the trial and the cylinder was moved one additional time. In accord with optimal predictions, we found that people compensate by aligning the approach direction with covariance angle to maintain grasp efficiency. This compensation results in higher probability to achieve stable grasps at first contact than non-compensation strategies in grasping objects with directional position uncertainty, and the results provide the first demonstration that humans compensate for uncertainty in a complex purposive task. Optimal sensorimotor control models actions as decisions that maximize the desirableness of outcomes, where the desirableness is captured by an expected cost or utility to each action sequence. These models provide explanations for many aspects of our ability to compensate for uncertainty, but they have not been applied to understanding purposive movements—movements involving the application of forces to change the relative position of objects and the actor in the environment. Using time efficiency as a natural cost function, we present a statistical optimal control analysis of uncertainty compensation strategies in a purposive movement task, grasping an object with directional position uncertainty. In accord with the predictions of the analysis, the experimental results showed that people compensate for uncertainty by adopting grasp strategies that increase the chance to produce a stable grasp at first contact. Our findings suggest that visuomotor system plans for uncertainty even in complex purposive movements.},

Steps without luminance reversal induced small but consistent ocular following in the direction of the steps at ultra-short latency ({\textless}80 ms). Steps with luminance reversal induced small but consistent tracking at the same latency but in the direction opposite to the actual displacement. Tuning curves describing the dependence of initial ocular following on the amplitude of the displacement had a form approximating the derivative of a Gaussian and were well fit by Gabor functions, the cosine term being phase shifted 180$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$ by the luminance reversal.

The intervening layers process the signals–among other tasks, adjusting neural responses under different lighting conditions and increasingly distinguishing objects from their backgrounds. Vision researchers estimate that careful study of the anatomy and physiology of the vertebrate retina has clarified about half of all the interactions in this tissue.},

We show that electrical microstimulation in the motion-sensitive middle temporal area ({MT}) of extrastriate visual cortex instructs learning in smooth eye movements in a way that closely mimics the learning instructed by real visual motion. We conclude that {MT} provides instructive signals for motor learning in smooth pursuit eye movements under natural conditions, suggesting a similar role for sensory cortices in many kinds of learned behaviors.},

Cortical neurons responded to sensory stimuli by progressing through sequences of states, identifiable only in examinations of simultaneously recorded ensembles. The specific times at which ensembles transitioned from state to state varied from trial to trial, but the state sequences were reliable and stimulus-specific. Thus, the characterization of ensemble responses in terms of state sequences captured facets of sensory processing that are missing from, and obscured in, other analyses. This work provides evidence that sensory neurons act as parts of a systems-level dynamic process, the nature of which can best be appreciated through observation of distributed ensembles.},

Together, these show that at present we can rightfully claim to understand only 10 to 20\% of how V1 actually operates under normal conditions. The goal in pointing out these things is not simply to tear down the current framework, but rather to make room for new theories that are essential for understanding V1 and its relation to perception.},

	abstract = {Self-motion, steering, and obstacle avoidance during navigation in the real world require humans to travel along curved paths. Many perceptual models have been proposed that focus on heading, which specifies the direction of travel along straight paths, but not on path curvature, which humans accurately perceive and is critical to everyday locomotion. In primates, including humans, dorsal medial superior temporal area ({MSTd}) has been implicated in heading perception. However, the majority of {MSTd} neurons respond optimally to spiral patterns, rather than to the radial expansion patterns associated with heading. No existing theory of curved path perception explains the neural mechanisms by which humans accurately assess path and no functional role for spiral-tuned cells has yet been proposed. Here we present a computational model that demonstrates how the continuum of observed cells (radial to circular) in {MSTd} can simultaneously code curvature and heading across the neural population. Curvature is encoded through the spirality of the most active cell, and heading is encoded through the visuotopic location of the center of the most active cell's receptive field. Model curvature and heading errors fit those made by humans. Our model challenges the view that the function of {MSTd} is heading estimation, based on our analysis we claim that it is primarily concerned with trajectory estimation and the simultaneous representation of both curvature and heading. In our model, temporal dynamics afford time-history in the neural representation of optic flow, which may modulate its structure. This has far-reaching implications for the interpretation of studies that assume that optic flow is, and should be, represented as an instantaneous vector field. Our results suggest that spiral motion patterns that emerge in spatio-temporal optic flow are essential for guiding self-motion along complex trajectories, and that cells in {MSTd} are specifically tuned to extract complex trajectory estimation from flow. Much human and primate psychological and electrophysiological research on visually-guided navigation has focused on heading perception, defined as the instantaneous direction of travel. However, the perception of path of travel, or trajectory, is arguably more important, because it informs in a more general sense whether the observer is on a collision course with moving objects or will intercept a target. In the present article, we describe a theory based on physiological evidence of how primate visual area {MSTd} may simultaneously and dynamically encode heading and path. The model connects many different sources of data, including psychophysics on human perception of heading and path with and without eye movements, and primate electrophysiological data on path-selective cells in {MSTd}. We propose neural mechanisms explaining why humans report traveling along curved paths when the display represents a straight path with simulated eye rotations. We predict that perceptual sensitivity to heading and path emerges in primate {MSTd} through the dynamical and competitive interactions between neurons tuned to the continuum of spiral-radial patterns.},

The neural response is analysed in the framework of information theory, using methods that are free from assumptions. We demonstrate that information about the motion trajectory increases as the light level increases over a natural range. This indicates that the fly's brain utilizes the increase in photon flux to extract more information from the photoreceptor array, suggesting that imprecision in neural signals is dominated by photon shot noise in the physical input, rather than by noise generated within the nervous system itself.},

These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states. A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale. In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges. However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions. Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat. When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions. During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags.},

This paper addresses the question in conducting a novel shape analysis of approach and adjustment phases in rapid voluntary target aiming and 2-D reaching hand actions. A number of mode changing experiments are reported that investigate these actions under a range of goals and conditions. After a typically roughly aimed approach, regular projective adjustment is observed that has height and velocity kinematic profiles that are scaled copies of one another. This empirical property is encapsulated as a novel self-similar shift function . The mathematics shows that the biological shifts consist of continual deviation from their full Taylor series everywhere throughout their interval, which is a deep form of plasticity not described before. The experimental results find the same approach and adjustment strategy to occur with behavioural trajectories over the full and varied range of tested goals and conditions. The trajectory shapes have a large degree of predictability through using the shift function to handle extensive variation in the trajectories' adjustment across individual behaviours and subjects. We provide connections between the behavioural features and results and various neural studies to show how the methodology may be exploited. The conclusion is that a roughly aimed approach followed by a specific highly plastic shift adjustment can provide a regular basis for fast and accurate goal-directed motion in a simple and generalisable way.},

We show that the resulting synaptic connectivity matrix has the following properties: it is sparse, with a large fraction of zero synaptic weights ('potential' synapses); bidirectionally coupled pairs of neurons are over-represented in comparison to a random network; and bidirectionally connected pairs have stronger synapses on average than unidirectionally connected pairs. All these features reproduce quantitatively available data on connectivity in cortex.

The visual motion system has evolved as an exquisite machinery adapted to reconstruct the direction and speed of the object of interest within a few dozen milliseconds. In the last decade, tremendous progress has been made in the understanding of how the outputs of local motion detectors are integrated. In particular, its dynamics are now unveiled at neuronal and behavioral levels. Solutions for fundamental computational problems such as the aperture problem and the interplay between motion segmentation and integration have been proposed from these works and biologically-realistic simulations are been proposed. Such a multi-level approach is rooted in the fact that dynamics of these solutions can be tackled at different scales using similar tasks and stimuli. Dynamics of Visual Motion Processing offers an overview of recent work on the dynamics of motion integration with inter-related examples taken from physiology (both single-neuron and population activity) and psychophysics as well as sensorimotor control or active vision. The last section presents three different approaches for understanding and modeling motion perception of natural scenes, complex 3D layout, and biological motion.},

Implementing such models using readily available computing clusters is now within the grasp of many labs and would provide scientists with the opportunity to experiment with both hard-wired connection schemes and structure-learning algorithms inspired by animal learning and developmental studies.

Multivariate analysis of the range of sparseness values showed that 67\% of the variance was accounted for by differing response patterns to moving gratings. Repeat presentation of images showed that response variance for natural images exaggerated sparseness measures; variance was scaled with mean response, but with a lower Fano factor than for the responses to moving gratings. This response variability and the "soft" sparse responses (Rehn and Sommer, 2007) raise the question of what constitutes a reliable neuronal response and imply parallel signaling by multiple neurons. We investigated whether the temporal structure of responses might be reliable enough to give additional information about natural scenes. Poststimulus time histogram shape was similar for "strong" and "weak" stimuli, with no systematic change in first-spike latency with stimulus strength. The variance of first-spike latency for repeat presentations of the same image was greater than the latency variance between images. In general, responses to flashed natural scenes do not seem compatible with a sparse encoding in which neurons fire rarely but reliably.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that the various computations underlying spatial cognition can be implemented using statistical inference in a single probabilistic model. Inference is implemented using a common set of 'lower-level' computations involving forward and backward inference over time. For example, to estimate where you are in a known environment, forward inference is used to optimally combine location estimates from path integration with those from sensory input. To decide which way to turn to reach a goal, forward inference is used to compute the likelihood of reaching that goal under each option. To work out which environment you are in, forward inference is used to compute the likelihood of sensory observations under the different hypotheses. For reaching sensory goals that require a chaining together of decisions, forward inference can be used to compute a state trajectory that will lead to that goal, and backward inference to refine the route and estimate control signals that produce the required trajectory. We propose that these computations are reflected in recent findings of pattern replay in the mammalian brain. Specifically, that theta sequences reflect decision making, theta flickering reflects model selection, and remote replay reflects route and motor planning. We also propose a mapping of the above computational processes onto lateral and medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.},

The time course of {MT} neuron responses was recorded in anesthetized macaque monkeys during target motions that covered the range of dynamics normally seen during smooth pursuit eye movements. When the target motion provided steps of target speed, {MT} neurons showed a continuum from purely tonic responses to those with large transient pulses of firing at the onset of motion. Cells with large transient responses for steps of target speed also had larger responses for smooth accelerations than for decelerations through the same range of target speeds. Condition-test experiments with pairs of 64 msec pulses of target speed revealed response attenuation at short interpulse intervals in cells with large transient responses. For sinusoidal modulation of target speed, {MT} neuron responses were strongly modulated for frequencies up to, but not higher than, 8 Hz. The phase of the responses was consistent with a 90 msec time delay between target velocity and firing rate. We created a model that reproduced the dynamic responses of {MT} cells using divisive gain control, used the model to visualize the population response in {MT} to individual stimuli, and devised weighted-averaging computations to reconstruct target speed and acceleration from the population response. Target speed could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to its preferred speed. Target acceleration could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to the product of preferred speed and a measure of the size of its transient response.},

We describe a hierarchical model of predictive coding and simulations that capture these temporal variations in neuronal response properties. We focus on the {LGN}-V1 circuit and find that after training on natural images the model exhibits the brain's {LGN}-V1 connectivity structure, in which the structure of V1 receptive fields is linked to the spatial alignment and properties of center-surround cells in the {LGN}. In addition, the spatio-temporal response profile of {LGN} model neurons is biphasic in structure, resembling the biphasic response structure of neurons in cat {LGN}. Moreover, the model displays a specific pattern of influence of feedback, where {LGN} receptive fields that are aligned over a simple cell receptive field zone of the same polarity decrease their responses while neurons of opposite polarity increase their responses with feedback. This phase-reversed pattern of influence was recently observed in neurophysiology. These results corroborate the idea that predictive feedback is a general coding strategy in the brain.},

	abstract = {Replay of neuronal activity during hippocampal sharp wave-ripples ({SWRs}) is essential in memory formation. To understand the mechanisms underlying the initiation of irregularly occurring {SWRs} and the generation of periodic ripples, we selectively manipulated different components of the {CA}3 network in mouse hippocampal slices. We recorded {EPSCs} and {IPSCs} to examine the buildup of neuronal activity preceding {SWRs} and analyzed the distribution of time intervals between subsequent {SWR} events. Our results suggest that {SWRs} are initiated through a combined refractory and stochastic mechanism. {SWRs} initiate when firing in a set of spontaneously active pyramidal cells triggers a gradual, exponential buildup of activity in the recurrent {CA}3 network. We showed that this tonic excitatory envelope drives reciprocally connected parvalbumin-positive basket cells, which start ripple-frequency spiking that is phase-locked through reciprocal inhibition. The synchronized {GABAA} receptor-mediated currents give rise to a major component of the ripple-frequency oscillation in the local field potential and organize the phase-locked spiking of pyramidal cells. Optogenetic stimulation of parvalbumin-positive cells evoked full {SWRs} and {EPSC} sequences in pyramidal cells. Even with excitation blocked, tonic driving of parvalbumin-positive cells evoked ripple oscillations. Conversely, optogenetic silencing of parvalbumin-positive cells interrupted the {SWRs} or inhibited their occurrence. Local drug applications and modeling experiments confirmed that the activity of parvalbumin-positive perisomatic inhibitory neurons is both necessary and sufficient for ripple-frequency current and rhythm generation. These interneurons are thus essential in organizing pyramidal cell activity not only during gamma oscillation, but, in a different configuration, during {SWRs}.},

	abstract = {In the intact brain neurons are constantly exposed to intense synaptic activity. This heavy barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs was recreated in vitro by injecting a noisy current, generated as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, into the soma of rat neocortical pyramidal cells. The response to such in vivo-like currents was studied systematically by analyzing the time development of the instantaneous spike frequency, and when possible, the stationary mean spike frequency as a function of both the mean and the variance of the input current. All cells responded with an in vivo-like action potential activity with stationary statistics that could be sustained throughout long stimulation intervals (tens of seconds), provided the frequencies were not too high. The temporal evolution of the response revealed the presence of mechanisms of fast and slow spike frequency adaptation, and a medium duration mechanism of facilitation. For strong input currents, the slow adaptation mechanism made the spike frequency response nonstationary. The minimal frequencies that caused strong slow adaptation (a decrease in the spike rate by more than 1 Hz/s), were in the range 30-80 Hz and depended on the pipette solution used. The stationary response function has been fitted by two simple models of integrate-and-fire neurons endowed with a frequency-dependent modification of the input current. This accounts for all the fast and slow mechanisms of adaptation and facilitation that determine the stationary response, and proved necessary to fit the model to the experimental data. The coefficient of variability of the interspike interval was also in part captured by the model neurons, by tuning the parameters of the model to match the mean spike frequencies only. We conclude that the integrate-and-fire model with spike-frequency-dependent adaptation/facilitation is an adequate model reduction of cortical cells when the mean spike-frequency response to in vivo-like currents with stationary statistics is considered.},

We collected a large database of eye movements from 54 subjects on 18 high-resolution videos of outdoor scenes and measured their variability using the Normalized Scanpath Saliency, which we extended to the temporal domain. Even though up to about 80\% of subjects looked at the same image region in some video parts, variability usually was much greater. Eye movements on natural movies were then compared with eye movements in several control conditions. "Stop-motion" movies had almost identical semantic content as the original videos but lacked continuous motion. Hollywood action movie trailers were used to probe the upper limit of eye movement coherence that can be achieved by deliberate camera work, scene cuts, etc. In a "repetitive" condition, subjects viewed the same movies ten times each over the course of 2 days. Results show several systematic differences between conditions both for general eye movement parameters such as saccade amplitude and fixation duration and for eye movement variability. Most importantly, eye movements on static images are initially driven by stimulus onset effects and later, more so than on continuous videos, by subject-specific idiosyncrasies; eye movements on Hollywood movies are significantly more coherent than those on natural movies. We conclude that the stimuli types often used in laboratory experiments, static images and professionally cut material, are not very representative of natural viewing behavior.

To correctly interpret these observations it is important to understand the origin of neuronal correlations. Here we study how cells in large recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons interact and how the associated correlations affect stationary states of idle network activity. We demonstrate that the structure of the connectivity matrix of such networks induces considerable correlations between synaptic currents as well as between subthreshold membrane potentials, provided Dale's principle is respected. If, in contrast, synaptic weights are randomly distributed, input correlations can vanish, even for densely connected networks. Although correlations are strongly attenuated when proceeding from membrane potentials to action potentials (spikes), the resulting weak correlations in the spike output can cause substantial fluctuations in the population activity, even in highly diluted networks. We show that simple mean-field models that take the structure of the coupling matrix into account can adequately describe the power spectra of the population activity. The consequences of Dale's principle on correlations and rate fluctuations are discussed in the light of recent experimental findings.},

	abstract = {Directionally selective ({DS}) neurons are found in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) of rabbits and rodents, and in rabbits, {LGN} {DS} cells project to primary visual cortex. Here, we compare visual response properties of {LGN} {DS} neurons with those of layer 4 simple cells, most of which show strong direction/orientation selectivity. These populations differed dramatically, suggesting that {DS} cells may not contribute significantly to the synthesis of simple receptive fields: 1) whereas the first harmonic component (F1)-to-mean firing rate (F0) ratios of {LGN} {DS} cells are strongly nonlinear, those of simple cells are strongly linear; 2) whereas {LGN} {DS} cells have overlapped {ON}/{OFF} subfields, simple cells have either a single {ON} or {OFF} subfield or two spatially separate subfields; and 3) whereas the preferred directions of {LGN} {DS} cells are closely tied to the four cardinal directions, the directional preferences of simple cells are more evenly distributed. We further show that directional selectivity in {LGN} {DS} neurons is strongly enhanced by alertness via two mechanisms, 1) an increase in responses to stimulation in the preferred direction, and 2) an enhanced suppression of responses to stimuli moving in the null direction. Finally, our simulations show that these two consequences of alertness could each serve, in a vector-based population code, to hasten the computation of stimulus direction when rabbits become alert.

	abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of an attentional mechanism for forming position- and scale-invariant representations of objects in the visual world. The model relies on a set of control neurons to dynamically modify the synaptic strengths of intracortical connections so that information from a windowed region of primary visual cortex (V1) is selectively routed to higher cortical areas. Local spatial relationships (i.e., topography) within the attentional window are preserved as information is routed through the cortex. This enables attended objects to be represented in higher cortical areas within an object-centered reference frame that is position and scale invariant. We hypothesize that the pulvinar may provide the control signals for routing information through the cortex. The dynamics of the control neurons are governed by simple differential equations that could be realized by neurobiologically plausible circuits. In preattentive mode, the control neurons receive their input from a low-level “saliency map” representing potentially interesting regions of a scene. During the pattern recognition phase, control neurons are driven by the interaction between top-down (memory) and bottom-up (retinal input) sources. The model respects key neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and psychophysical data relating to attention, and it makes a variety of experimentally testable predictions.},

A good interpretation of neurobiological findings involves a computational model that simulates signal processing of the visual cortex. In part, this is likely achieved step by step from early to late areas of visual perception. While several algorithms have been proposed for learning feature detectors, only few studies at hand cover the issue of biologically plausible learning of such invariance. In this study, a set of Hebbian learning rules based on calcium dynamics and homeostatic regulations of single neurons is proposed. Their performance is verified within a simple model of the primary visual cortex to learn so-called complex cells, based on a sequence of static images. As a result, the learned complex-cell responses are largely invariant to phase and position.},

It is widely believed that the content of memory is object-based: Memory stores integrated objects, not independent features. We asked participants to report the color and orientation of an object and found that memory errors were largely independent: Even when one of the object's features was entirely forgotten, the other feature was often reported. This finding contradicts object-based models and challenges fundamental assumptions about the organization of information in working memory. We propose an alternative framework involving independent self-sustaining representations that may fail probabilistically and independently for each feature. This account predicts that the degree of independence in feature storage is determined by the degree of overlap in neural coding during perception. Consistent with this prediction, we found that errors for jointly encoded dimensions were less independent than errors for independently encoded dimensions.},

	abstract = {Illusory figures demonstrate the visual system's ability to infer surfaces under conditions of fragmented sensory input. To investigate the role of midlevel visual area V4 in visual surface completion, we used multielectrode arrays to measure spiking responses to two types of visual stimuli: Kanizsa patterns that induce the perception of an illusory surface and physically similar control stimuli that do not. Neurons in V4 exhibited stronger and sometimes rhythmic spiking responses for the illusion-promoting configurations compared with controls. Moreover, this elevated response depended on the precise alignment of the neuron's peak visual field sensitivity (receptive field focus) with the illusory surface itself. Neurons whose receptive field focus was over adjacent inducing elements, less than 1.5° away, did not show response enhancement to the illusion. Neither receptive field sizes nor fixational eye movements could account for this effect, which was present in both single-unit signals and multiunit activity. These results suggest that the active perceptual completion of surfaces and shapes, which is a fundamental problem in natural visual experience, draws upon the selective enhancement of activity within a distinct subpopulation of neurons in cortical area V4.},

In a target detection task, we randomly assigned high or low reliability to each item on a trial-by-trial basis. An optimal observer would weight the observations by their trial-to-trial reliability and combine them using a specific nonlinear integration rule. We found that humans were near-optimal, regardless of whether distractors were homogeneous or heterogeneous and whether reliability was manipulated through contrast or shape.

Flight was conducted under closed-loop control by a bio-inspired algorithm for visual guidance with feedback signals corresponding to the true optic flow that would be induced on an imager (computed by known kinematics and position of the robot relative to the environment). The robot had dynamics representative of a housefly-sized organism, although simplified to two-degree-of-freedom flight to generate uniaxial (azimuthal) optic flow on the retina in the plane of travel. Surfaces in the environment contained images of natural and man-made scenes that were captured by the moving sensor. Two bio-inspired motion detection algorithms and two computational optic flow estimation algorithms were applied to sequences of image data, and their performance as optic flow estimators was evaluated by estimating the mutual information between outputs and true optic flow in an equatorial section of the visual field. Mutual information for individual estimators at particular locations within the visual field was surprisingly low (less than 1 bit in all cases) and considerably poorer for the bio-inspired algorithms that the man-made computational algorithms. However, mutual information between weighted sums of these signals and comparable sums of the true optic flow showed significant increases for the bio-inspired algorithms, whereas such improvement did not occur for the computational algorithms. Such summation is representative of the spatial integration performed by wide-field motion-sensitive neurons in the third optic ganglia of flies.},

	abstract = {People are able to judge the current position of occluded moving objects. This operation is known as motion extrapolation. It has previously been suggested that motion extrapolation is independent of the oculomotor system. Here we revisited this question by measuring eye position while participants completed two types of motion extrapolation task. In one task, a moving visual target travelled rightwards, disappeared, then reappeared further along its trajectory. Participants discriminated correct reappearance times from incorrect (too early or too late) with a two-alternative forced-choice button press. In the second task, the target travelled rightwards behind a visible, rectangular occluder, and participants pressed a button at the time when they judged it should reappear. In both tasks, performance was significantly different under fixation as compared to free eye movement conditions. When eye movements were permitted, eye movements during occlusion were related to participants' judgements. Finally, even when participants were required to fixate, small changes in eye position around fixation ({\textless}2$^{\textrm{{\textbackslash}circ\$}}$) were influenced by occluded target motion. These results all indicate that overlapping systems control eye movements and judgements on motion extrapolation tasks. This has implications for understanding the mechanism underlying motion extrapolation. {\textbackslash}copyright 2011 The Experimental Psychology Society},

To answer this question, we trained two rhesus monkeys to direct their eyes towards imaginary targets defined by extrafoveal cues. Independent of the type of target, real or imaginary, the trajectory of target movement determined the type of eye movement produced: steps in target position resulted in saccades and ramps in target position resulted in smooth pursuit eye movements. There was a tendency for the latency of saccades as well as pursuit onset latency to be delayed in the case of an imaginary target in comparison to the real target. The initial eye acceleration during smooth pursuit initiation elicited by an imaginary target decreased in comparison to the acceleration elicited by a real target. The steady-state pursuit gain was quite similar during pursuit of an imaginary or a real target. Our results strengthen the notion that pursuit is not exclusively a foveal function.},

	abstract = {Navigation in a static environment along straight paths without eye movements produces radial optic flow fields. A singularity called the focus of expansion ({FoE}) specifies the direction of travel (heading) of the observer. Cells in primate dorsal medial superior temporal area ({MSTd}) respond to radial fields and are therefore thought to be heading-sensitive. Humans frequently shift their focus of attention while navigating, for example, depending on the favorable or threatening context of approaching independently moving objects. Recent neurophysiological studies show that the spatial tuning curves of primate {MSTd} neurons change based on the difference in visual angle between an attentional prime and the {FoE}. Moreover, the peak mean population activity in {MSTd} retreats linearly in time as the distance between the attentional prime and {FoE} increases. We present a dynamical neural circuit model that demonstrates the same linear temporal peak shift observed electrophysiologically. The model qualitatively matches the neuron tuning curves and population activation profiles. After model {MT} dynamically pools short-range motion, model {MSTd} incorporates recurrent competition between units tuned to different radial optic flow templates, and integrates attentional signals from model area frontal eye fields ({FEF}). In the model, population activity peaks occur when the recurrent competition is most active and uncertainty is greatest about the relative position of the {FoE}. The nature of attention, multiplicative or non-multiplicative, is largely irrelevant, so long as attention has a Gaussian-like profile. Using an appropriately tuned sigmoidal signal function to modulate recurrent feedback affords qualitative fits of deflections in the population activity that otherwise appear to be low-frequency noise. We predict that these deflections mark changes in the balance of attention between the priming and {FoE} locations.},

The results clearly show that people use many terms to describe autism. The most highly endorsed terms were 'autism' and 'on the autism spectrum', and to a lesser extent, 'autism spectrum disorder', for which there was consensus across community groups. The groups disagreed, however, on the use of several terms. The term 'autistic' was endorsed by a large percentage of autistic adults, family members/friends and parents but by considerably fewer professionals; 'person with autism' was endorsed by almost half of professionals but by fewer autistic adults and parents. Qualitative analysis of an open-ended question revealed the reasons underlying respondents' preferences.

	abstract = {People may deny responsibility for negative consequences of their actions by claiming that they were “only obeying orders.” The “Nuremberg defense” offers one extreme example, though it is often dismissed as merely an attempt to avoid responsibility. Milgram's classic laboratory studies reported widespread obedience to an instruction to harm, suggesting that social coercion may alter mechanisms of voluntary agency, and hence abolish the normal experience of being in control of one's own actions. However, Milgram's and other studies relied on dissembling and on explicit measures of agency, which are known to be biased by social norms. Here, we combined coercive instructions to administer harm to a co-participant, with implicit measures of sense of agency, based on perceived compression of time intervals between voluntary actions and their outcomes, and with electrophysiological recordings. In two experiments, an experimenter ordered a volunteer to make a key-press action that caused either financial penalty or demonstrably painful electric shock to their co-participant, thereby increasing their own financial gain. Coercion increased the perceived interval between action and outcome, relative to a situation where participants freely chose to inflict the same harms. Interestingly, coercion also reduced the neural processing of the outcomes of one's own action. Thus, people who obey orders may subjectively experience their actions as closer to passive movements than fully voluntary actions. Our results highlight the complex relation between the brain mechanisms that generate the subjective experience of voluntary actions and social constructs, such as responsibility.},

	abstract = {1. Previous experiments have shown that punctate chemical lesions within the middle temporal area ({MT}) of the superior temporal sulcus ({STS}) produce deficits in the initiation and maintenance of pursuit eye movements (10, 34). The present experiments were designed to test the effect of such chemical lesions in an area within the {STS} to which {MT} projects, the medial superior temporal area ({MST}). 2. We injected ibotenic acid into localized regions of {MST}, and we observed two deficits in pursuit eye movements, a retinotopic deficit and a directional deficit. 3. The retinotopic deficit in pursuit initiation was characterized by the monkey's inability to match eye speed to target speed or to adjust the amplitude of the saccade made to acquire the target to compensate for target motion. This deficit was related to the initiation of pursuit to targets moving in any direction in the visual field contralateral to the side of the brain with the lesion. This deficit was similar to the deficit we found following damage to extrafoveal {MT} except that the affected area of the visual field frequently extended throughout the entire contralateral visual field tested. 4. The directional deficit in pursuit maintenance was characterized by a failure to match eye speed to target speed once the fovea had been brought near the moving target. This deficit occurred only when the target was moving toward the side of the lesion, regardless of whether the target began to move in the ipsilateral or contralateral visual field. There was no deficit in the amplitude of saccades made to acquire the target, or in the amplitude of the catch-up saccades made to compensate for the slowed pursuit. The directional deficit is similar to the one we described previously following chemical lesions of the foveal representation in the {STS}. 5. Retinotopic deficits resulted from any of our injections in {MST}. Directional deficits resulted from lesions limited to subregions within {MST}, particularly lesions that invaded the floor of the {STS} and the posterior bank of the {STS} just lateral to {MT}. Extensive damage to the densely myelinated area of the anterior bank or to the posterior parietal area on the dorsal lip of the anterior bank produced minimal directional deficits. 6. We conclude that damage to visual motion processing in {MST} underlies the retinotopic pursuit deficit just as it does in {MT}. {MST} appears to be a sequential step in visual motion processing that occurs before all of the visual motion information is transmitted to the brainstem areas related to pursuit.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

We consider an alternative scheme using basis functions in which the cells have retinotopic receptive fields modulated by the orientation of the object and task-related signals. We show that this alternative is consistent with single-cell data, is computationally efficient, and accounts for object-centered hemineglect, a syndrome observed in humans after fronto-parietal lesions.},

In general, the variance of a neuron's firing rate is directly proportional to its mean firing rate. The probability that a neuron will fire a criterion number of impulses on a stimulus trial grows monotonically with the contrast of a sinusoidal grating stimulus. Neural probability functions prepared either by computing the probability of criterion response or by integrating receiver operating characteristics to yield the probability of correct choice in a two-alternative forced-choice situation resemble psychometric functions obtained in psychophysical and behavioral experiments on humans and animals, but are shallower in slope. The slopes of neuronal probability functions are slightly higher when they are estimated over short time periods, but even so do not equal the slopes measured psychophysically in human and monkey observers. This discrepancy in slope could be explained if the whole observer responded only when about four neurons were active together.},

	abstract = {The developing visual system of many mammalian species is partially structured and organized even before the onset of vision. Spontaneous neural activity, which spreads in waves across the retina, has been suggested to play a major role in these prenatal structuring processes. Recently, it has been shown that when employing an efficient coding strategy, such as sparse coding, these retinal activity patterns lead to basis functions that resemble optimal stimuli of simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1). Here we present the results of applying a coding strategy that optimizes for temporal slowness, namely Slow Feature Analysis ({SFA}), to a biologically plausible model of retinal waves. Previously, {SFA} has been successfully applied to model parts of the visual system, most notably in reproducing a rich set of complex-cell features by training {SFA} with quasi-natural image sequences. In the present work, we obtain {SFA} units that share a number of properties with cortical complex-cells by training on simulated retinal waves. The emergence of two distinct properties of the {SFA} units (phase invariance and orientation tuning) is thoroughly investigated via control experiments and mathematical analysis of the input-output functions found by {SFA}. The results support the idea that retinal waves share relevant temporal and spatial properties with natural visual input. Hence, retinal waves seem suitable training stimuli to learn invariances and thereby shape the developing early visual system such that it is best prepared for coding input from the natural world. It is believed that our sensory systems are adapted to statistical properties of behaviorally relevant elements in our natural environments. In the case of vision, one adaptation principle that has been put forward is the so-called slowness principle. However, the visual system is partially structured even before eye opening, when no natural input is available yet. Thus, spontaneous neural activity in the developing visual system of mammals (so-called retinal waves) has been suggested to contribute to shaping connections in early visual areas before the onset of vision. Here we aim to bring these two ideas together. Specifically, we apply an algorithm that implements the slowness principle to simulated retinal waves. The algorithm is set to encode the retinal wave input and thus has to extract relevant features from that input. After encoding, we are able to investigate the emerged representation and we find that the extracted features bear strong similarity to features that are encoded by neurons in the early visual system. These features are the building blocks for an object representation that is independent of the object's position in the visual field.},

The paper also recalls the notion of multidimensional scaling and discusses its algorithmic implementation.

These are obtained by maximising a variational action with respect to conditional densities, under a fixed-form assumption about their form. The action or path-integral of free-energy represents a lower bound on the model's log-evidence or marginal likelihood required for model selection and averaging. This approach rests on formulating the optimisation dynamically, in generalised coordinates of motion. The resulting scheme can be used for online Bayesian inversion of nonlinear dynamic causal models and is shown to outperform existing approaches, such as Kalman and particle filtering. Furthermore, it provides for dual and triple inferences on a system's states, parameters and hyperparameters using exactly the same principles.

Recently it was found that in one-dimensional {CANNs}, short-term synaptic depression can destabilize bump-shaped neuronal attractor activity profiles. In this article, we study two-dimensional {CANNs} with short-term synaptic depression and spike frequency adaptation. We found that the dynamics of {CANNs} with short-term synaptic depression and {CANNs} with spike frequency adaptation are qualitatively similar.

A standard population code interpretation method, the Poisson model, starts from a description as to how a single value of an underlying quantity can generate the activities of each unit in the population. In casting it in the encoding-decoding framework, we find that this model is too restrictive to describe fully the activities of units in population codes in higher processing areas, such as the medial temporal area. Under a more powerful model, the population activity can convey information not only about a single value of some quantity but also about its whole distribution, including its variance, and perhaps even the certainty the system has in the actual presence in the world of the entity generating this quantity. We propose a novel method for forming such probabilistic interpretations of population codes and compare it to the existing method.},

While the linear {RFs} of early neurons have been well studied, {RFs} of cortical complex cells are nonlinear and therefore difficult to characterize, especially in the context of natural stimuli. In this study, we used a nonlinear technique to compute the {RFs} of complex cells from their responses to natural images. We found that each {RF} is well described by a small number of subunits, which are oriented, localized, and bandpass. These subunits contribute to neuronal responses in a contrast-dependent, polarity-invariant manner, and they can largely predict the orientation and spatial frequency tuning of the cell. Although the {RF} structures measured with natural images were similar to those measured with random stimuli, natural images were more effective for driving complex cells, thus facilitating rapid identification of the subunits.

To accurately interpret optic flow induced by self-motion, neurons in many dipteran flies smooth this "pattern noise" by wide-field spatial integration. We investigated the role that size and shape of the receptive field plays in smoothing out pattern noise in two unusual hoverfly optic flow neurons: one ({HSN}) with an exceptionally small receptive field and one ({HSNE}) with a larger receptive field. We compared the local and global responses to a sequence of panoramic natural images in these two neurons with a parsimonious model for elementary motion detection weighted for their spatial receptive fields. Combined with manipulation of size and contrast of the stimulus images, this allowed us to separate spatial integration properties arising from the receptive field, from other local and global non-linearities, such as motion adaptation and dendritic gain control. We show that receptive field properties alone are poor predictors of the response to natural scenes. If anything, additional non-linearity enhances the pattern dependence of {HSN}'s response, particularly to vertically elongated features, suggesting that it may serve a role in forward fixation during hovering.},

In this model the development is described as an activity- dependent competition between four types of input from the lateral geniculate nucleus onto a cortical cell, viz. non-lagged {ON} and {OFF} and lagged {ON} and {OFF} inputs. In the present paper simulation results and a first analysis are presented for this model. We study the developmental process both before and after eye-opening and compare the results with experimental data from reverse correlation measurements. The outcome of the developmental process is determined mainly by the spatial and the temporal correlations between the different inputs. In particular, if the mean correlation between non-lagged and lagged inputs is weak, receptive fields with a widely varying degree of direction selectivity emerge. However, spatiotemporal receptive fields may show rotation of their preferred orientation as a function of response delay. Even if the mean correlation between two types of temporal input is not weak, direction-selective receptive fields may emerge because of an intracortical interaction between different cortical maps. In an environment of moving lines or gratings, direction-selective receptive fields develop only if the distribution of the directions of motion presented during development shows some anisotropy. In this case, a continuous map of preferred direction is also shown to develop.},

To provoke fear in {SM}, we exposed her to live snakes and spiders, took her on a tour of a haunted house, and showed her emotionally evocative films. On no occasion did {SM} exhibit fear, and she never endorsed feeling more than minimal levels of fear. Likewise, across a large battery of self-report questionnaires, 3 months of real-life experience sampling, and a life history replete with traumatic events, {SM} repeatedly demonstrated an absence of overt fear manifestations and an overall impoverished experience of fear.

Here we describe a framework for cortical synaptic plasticity termed the ” Convallis rule”, mathematically derived from a principle of unsupervised learning via constrained optimization. Implementation of the rule caused a recurrent cortex-like network of simulated spiking neurons to develop rate representations of real-world speech stimuli, enabling classification by a downstream linear decoder. Applied to spike patterns used in in vitro plasticity experiments, the rule reproduced multiple results including and beyond {STDP}. However {STDP} alone produced poorer learning performance. The mathematical form of the rule is consistent with a dual coincidence detector mechanism that has been suggested by experiments in several synaptic classes of juvenile neocortex. Based on this confluence of normative, phenomenological, and mechanistic evidence, we suggest that the rule may approximate a fundamental computational principle of the neocortex. The circuits of the sensory cortex are able to extract useful information from sensory inputs because of their exquisitely organized synaptic connections. These connections are wired largely through experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Although many details of both the phenomena and cellular mechanisms of cortical synaptic plasticity are now known, an understanding of the computational principles by which synaptic plasticity wires cortical networks lags far behind this experimental data. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for cortical plasticity termed the ” Convallis rule”. The computational power of this rule is demonstrated by its ability to cause simulated cortical networks to learn representations of real-world speech data. Application of the rule to paradigms used to probe synaptic plasticity in vitro reproduced a large number of experimental findings, and the mathematical form of the rule is consistent with a dual coincidence detector mechanism that has been suggested experimentally in juvenile neocortex.

Hubel and Wiesel's demonstration that units in the primary visual cortex of the mammal respond preferentially to elongated contours of specific orientation encouraged the inquiry into whether binocular disparity might not similarly be represented as an attribute interdigitated within the orderly progression of position. When this was found to indeed be the case, this entrained a brisk research activity into the disparity of receptive fields of single units in the primary visual cortex and the influence on their response of the three-dimensional locations of outside world stimuli. That cells' preferred orientations covered the whole gamut whereas space perception required only horizontal disparity was an apparent paradox that needed resolution. A connection with an observer's stereoscopic performance was made by the discovery that cells in the primate primary visual cortex display good tuning to the disparity in random-dot stereograms. But a wide gap still remains between the properties of these cortical units and human stereo thresholds in simple target configurations, let alone depth judgments in which perceptual and cognitive factors enter. When the neural circuits in the primary visual cortex that are involved in processing depth are eventually traced in detail they will also need to have properties that allow for the plasticity in learning and experience.},

Different models have been proposed to try to understand this phenomenon, but the precise mechanism remains unknown and the polarization unexploited. We suggest that when Fresnel's laws are applied to the unguided oblique rays, that the cylindrical geometry of the blue cones in the fovea along with their distribution induces an extrinsic dichroism and could explain why the human eye is sensitive to polarization. We have constructed an artificial eye model system using the same laws and were able to photograph the appearance of entoptic-like blue-dark brushes, confirming the observations and our mathematical simulations. Moreover, our in vivo and in vitro tests show that in addition to the usual 3s fading time measured using a stationary stimulus, there exists for this entoptic image a short extra creating and erasing time of about 0.1s, using a dynamical stimulus. We have also found that, surprisingly, the rotating pattern is more regular and symmetrical with one of our two eyes around a more circular blue cone-free area, the dominant eye. Our results suggest that the polarization sense can provide important information in many areas that remain to be explored. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Our aim is to better understand how culture and context interact with human biology to shape human behavior, cognition, and experience. We attempt to integrate several related approaches in the study of the embodied, cognitive, and affective substrates of sociality and culture and the sociocultural scaffolding of experience. The integrative framework we propose bridges cognitive and social sciences to provide (i) an expanded concept of ‘affordance' that extends to sociocultural forms of life, and (ii) a multilevel account of the socioculturally scaffolded forms of affordance learning and the transmission of affordances in patterned sociocultural practices and regimes of shared attention. This framework provides an account of how cultural content and normative practices are built on a foundation of contentless basic mental processes that acquire content through immersive participation of the agent in social practices that regulate joint attention and shared intentionality.},

	volume = {16},
	issn = {0306-4522},
	abstract = {Here we present an elaboration and a quantitative example for a hypothetical neuronal process, implementing what we refer to as the metaorganization principle. This process allows the internalization of external (body) geometries into the central nervous system ({CNS}) and a reciprocal and equally important action of the {CNS} geometry on the external (body) geometry. The hypothesis is based on the distinction, within the {CNS}, between covariant sensory and contravariant motor vectorial expressions of the extrinsic geometry. These sensory and motor expressions, given in natural co-ordinate systems, are transformed from one to the other by a neuronal network which acts as a metric tensor. The metric tensor determines the relationship of these two expressions and thus comprises the functional geometry of the system. The emergence through metaorganization of networks that implement such metric function is viewed as the result of interactions between the covariant motor execution which generates a physical action on the external world (via the musculoskeletal system) and the covariant sensory proprioception which measures the effect of such motor output. In this transformation of contravariants to covariants by the physical geometry of the motor system, a covariant metric tensor is expressed implicitly. However, co-ordinated motor action requires its dual tensor (the contravariant metric) which is assembled in the {CNS} based on the metaorganization principle, i.e. the ability of {CNS} and external geometries to mold one another. The two metric transformations acting on each other detect error signals whenever the match of the physical and functional geometries is imperfect. Such error signals are utilized by the metaorganization process to improve the match between the two metrics, so that with use the internal representation becomes increasingly homeometric with the geometry of the external world. The proposed physical process by which the metaorganization principle is implemented is based on oscillatory reverberation. If covariant proprioception is used as a recurrent signal to the motor apparatus, as if it were a contravariant motor expression, then reverberations at their steady-state yield the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the system. The stored eigenvectors and eigenvalues can serve, respectively, as a means for the genesis of a metric (in the form of its spectral representation) with the given eigenvectors and as a means of comparing the eigenvalues that are implicit in the external body geometry and those of the internal metric.({ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

	abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The out- side world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the gov- erning laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Sev- eral lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual “filling in,” visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

	abstract = {Empirical likelihood provides inferences whose validity does not depend on specifying a parametric model for the data. Because it uses a likelihood, the method has certain inherent advantages over resampling methods: it uses the data to determine the shape of the confidence regions, and it makes it easy to combined data from multiple sources. It also facilitates incorporating side information, and it simplifies accounting for censored, truncated, or biased sampling. One of the first books published on the subject, Empirical Likelihood offers an in-depth treatment of this method for constructing confidence regions and testing hypotheses. The author applies empirical likelihood to a range of problems, from those as simple as setting a confidence region for a univariate mean under {IID} sampling, to problems defined through smooth functions of means, regression models, generalized linear models, estimating equations, or kernel smooths, and to sampling with non-identically distributed data. Abundant figures offer visual reinforcement of the concepts and techniques. Examples from a variety of disciplines and detailed descriptions of algorithms-also posted on a companion Web site at- illustrate the methods in practice. Exercises help readers to understand and apply the methods. The method of empirical likelihood is now attracting serious attention from researchers in econometrics and biostatistics, as well as from statisticians. This book is your opportunity to explore its foundations, its advantages, and its application to a myriad of practical problems.},

In a paradigm requiring sustained vigilance for instance, we previously observed that higher prestimulus activity in a cingulo-insular-thalamic network facilitated subsequent perception. Here, we test our proposed interpretation that this network underpins maintenance of tonic alertness. We used simultaneous acquisition of functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and electroencephalography ({EEG}) in the absence of any paradigm to test an ensuing hypothesis, namely that spontaneous fluctuations in this {ICN}'s activity (as measured by {fMRI}) should show a positive correlation with the electrical signatures of tonic alertness (as recorded by concurrent {EEG}). We found in human subjects (19 male, 7 female) that activity in a network comprising dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, anterior prefrontal cortex and thalamus is positively correlated with global field power ({GFP}) of upper alpha band (10-12 Hz) oscillations, the most consistent electrical index of tonic alertness. Conversely, and in line with earlier findings, alpha band power was negatively correlated with activity in another {ICN}, the so-called dorsal attention network which is most prominently involved in selective spatial attention. We propose that the cingulo-insular-thalamic network serves maintaining tonic alertness through generalized expression of cortical alpha oscillations. Attention is mediated by activity in other systems, e.g., the dorsal attention network for space, selectively disrupts alertness-related suppression and hence manifests as local attenuation of alpha activity.},

	abstract = {Human behavior has long been recognized to display hierarchical structure: actions fit together into subtasks, which cohere into extended goal-directed activities. Arranging actions hierarchically has well established benefits, allowing behaviors to be represented efficiently by the brain, and allowing solutions to new tasks to be discovered easily. However, these payoffs depend on the particular way in which actions are organized into a hierarchy, the specific way in which tasks are carved up into subtasks. We provide a mathematical account for what makes some hierarchies better than others, an account that allows an optimal hierarchy to be identified for any set of tasks. We then present results from four behavioral experiments, suggesting that human learners spontaneously discover optimal action hierarchies. In order to accomplish everyday tasks, we often divide them up into subtasks: to make spaghetti, we (1) get out a pot, (2) fill it with water, (3) bring the water to a boil, and so forth. But how do we learn to subdivide our goals in this way? Work from computer science suggests that the way a task is subdivided or decomposed can have a dramatic impact on how easy the task is to accomplish: certain decompositions speed learning and planning compared to others. Moreover, some decompositions allow behaviors to be represented more simply. Despite this general insight, little work has been done to formalize these ideas. We outline a mathematical framework to address this question, based on methods for comparing between statistical models. We then present four behavioral experiments, showing that human learners spontaneously discover optimal task decompositions.},

To understand the underlying neural mechanisms we developed a large-scale neuron network model of the {BA}, composed of excitatory and inhibitory leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Excitatory {BA} neurons received conditioned stimulus ({CS})-related input from the adjacent lateral nucleus ({LA}) and contextual input from the hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}). We implemented a plasticity mechanism according to which {CS} and contextual synapses were potentiated if {CS} and contextual inputs temporally coincided on the afferents of the excitatory neurons. Our simulations revealed a differential recruitment of two distinct subpopulations of {BA} neurons during conditioning and extinction, mimicking the activation of experimentally observed cell populations. We propose that these two subgroups encode contextual specificity of fear and extinction memories, respectively. Mutual competition between them, mediated by feedback inhibition and driven by contextual inputs, regulates the activity in the central amygdala ({CEA}) thereby controlling amygdala output and fear behavior. The model makes multiple testable predictions that may advance our understanding of fear and extinction memories.},

Sound textures are distinguished by temporal homogeneity, suggesting they could be recognized with time-averaged statistics. To test this hypothesis, we processed real-world textures with an auditory model containing filters tuned for sound frequencies and their modulations, and measured statistics of the resulting decomposition. We then assessed the realism and recognizability of novel sounds synthesized to have matching statistics. Statistics of individual frequency channels, capturing spectral power and sparsity, generally failed to produce compelling synthetic textures; however, combining them with correlations between channels produced identifiable and natural-sounding textures. Synthesis quality declined if statistics were computed from biologically implausible auditory models. The results suggest that sound texture perception is mediated by relatively simple statistics of early auditory representations, presumably computed by downstream neural populations. The synthesis methodology offers a powerful tool for their further investigation. º Sound textures can be synthesized from summary statistics measured in natural sounds º Realism degrades when subsets of statistics are omitted or perturbed º Realism also degrades when biologically implausible statistics are used º Suggests texture statistics are computed by auditory system, used for recognition},

	abstract = {We examine the problem of estimating the spike trains of multiple neurons from voltage traces recorded on one or more extracellular electrodes. Traditional spike-sorting methods rely on thresholding or clustering of recorded signals to identify spikes. While these methods can detect a large fraction of the spikes from a recording, they generally fail to identify synchronous or near-synchronous spikes: cases in which multiple spikes overlap. Here we investigate the geometry of failures in traditional sorting algorithms, and document the prevalence of such errors in multi-electrode recordings from primate retina. We then develop a method for multi-neuron spike sorting using a model that explicitly accounts for the superposition of spike waveforms. We model the recorded voltage traces as a linear combination of spike waveforms plus a stochastic background component of correlated Gaussian noise. Combining this measurement model with a Bernoulli prior over binary spike trains yields a posterior distribution for spikes given the recorded data. We introduce a greedy algorithm to maximize this posterior that we call "binary pursuit". The algorithm allows modest variability in spike waveforms and recovers spike times with higher precision than the voltage sampling rate. This method substantially corrects cross-correlation artifacts that arise with conventional methods, and substantially outperforms clustering methods on both real and simulated data. Finally, we develop diagnostic tools that can be used to assess errors in spike sorting in the absence of ground truth.},

	abstract = {The smooth pursuit eye movement ({SPEM}) system is much more sensitive to target motion perturbations during pursuit than during fixation. This sensitivity is commonly attributed to a dynamic gain control mechanism. Neither the neural substrate nor the functional architecture for this gain control has been fully revealed. There are at least two cortical areas that crucially contribute to smooth pursuit and are therefore eligible sites for dynamic gain control: the medial superior temporal area ({MST}) and the pursuit area of the frontal eye fields ({FEFs}), which both project to brain stem premotor structures via parallel pathways. The aim of this study was to develop a model of smooth pursuit based on behavioral, anatomical, and neurophysiological results to account for nonlinear dynamic gain control. Using a behavioral paradigm in humans consisting of a sinusoidal oscillation (4 Hz, +/-8 degrees/s) superimposed on a constant velocity target motion (0-24 degrees/s), we were able to identify relevant gain control parameters in the model. A salient feature of our model is the emergence of two parallel pathways from higher visual cortical to lower motor areas in the brain stem that correspond to the {MST} and {FEF} pathways. Detailed analysis of the model revealed that one pathway mainly carries eye velocity related signals, whereas the other is associated mostly with eye acceleration. From comparison with known neurophysiological results we conclude that the dynamic gain control can be attributed to the {FEF} pathway, whereas the {MST} pathway serves as the basic circuit for maintaining an ongoing {SPEM}.},

	abstract = {In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply with their global integration during perception and behavior. In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity ({CN}), that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. {CN} is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. {CN} is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of {CN}. The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.},

We hypothesize that such populations support processes of interaction within parametric representations and integration of multiple sources of input and we propose to study these processes using distributions of population activation ({DPAs}) as a tool. Such distributions can be viewed as neuronal representations of continuous stimulus or task parameters. They are built from basis functions contributed by each neuron. These functions may be explicitly chosen based on tuning curves or receptive field profiles. Or they may be determined by minimizing the distance between chosen target distributions and the constructed {DPAs}. In both cases, construction of the {DPA} is based on a set of reference conditions in which the stimulus or task parameters are sampled experimentally. In a second step, basis functions are kept fixed, and the {DPAs} are used to explore time dependent processing, interaction and integration of information. For instance, stimuli which simultaneously specify multiple parameter values can be used to study interactions within the parametric representation. We review an experiment, in which the representation of retinal position is probed in this way, revealing fast excitatory interactions among neurons representing similar retinal positions and slower inhibitory interactions among neurons representing dissimilar retinal positions. Similarly, {DPAs} can be used to analyze different sources of input that are fused within a parametric representation. We review an experiment in which the representation of the direction of goal-directed arm movements in motor and premotor cortex is studied when prior and current information about upcoming movement tasks are integrated.},

We identify a population of neurons in area 1 that is highly sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion and whose motion signals are invariant across stimulus types and conditions. The motion signals conveyed by individual neurons in area 1 can account for the ability of human observers to discriminate the direction of motion of these stimuli, as measured in paired psychophysical experiments.

	abstract = {Offering proper evaluation methodology is essential to continue progress in modelling neural mechanisms in vision/visual information processing. Currently, evaluation of motion estimation models lacks a proper methodology for comparing their performance against the visual system. Here, we set the basis for such a new benchmark methodology which is based on human visual performance as measured in psychophysics, ocular following and neurobiology. This benchmark will enable comparisons between different kinds of models, but also it will challenge current motion estimation models and better characterize their properties with respect to visual cortex performance. To do so, we propose a database of image sequences taken from neuroscience and psychophysics literature. In this article, we focus on two aspects of motion estimation, which are the dynamics of motion integration and the respective influence between 1D versus 2D cues. Then, since motion models possibly deal with different kinds of motion representations and scale, we define here two general readouts based on a global motion estimation. Such readouts, namely eye movements and perceived motion will serve as a reference to compare simulated and experimental data. We evaluate the performance of several models on this data to establish the current state of the art. Models chosen for comparison have very different properties and internal mechanisms, such as feedforward normalisation of V1 and {MT} processing and recurrent feedback. As a whole, we provide here the basis for a valuable evaluation methodology to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of the visual cortex in motion perception.

One proposal for this consistent-object advantage is that ultrarapid scene categorization is influenced directly by ultrarapid recognition of particular objects within the scene. We instead asked whether a simpler mechanism that relied only on scene categorization without any explicit object recognition could explain this consistent-object advantage. We combined a computational model of scene recognition based on global scene statistics (A. Oliva \& A. Torralba, 2001) with a diffusion model of perceptual decision making (R. Ratcliff, 1978). This model is sufficient to account for the consistent-object advantage. The simulations suggest that this consistent-object advantage need not arise from ultrarapid object recognition influencing ultrarapid scene categorization, but from the inherent influence certain objects have on the global scene statistics diagnostic for scene categorization.},

Visual processing could thus be faster for faces than for any other kind of object. Moreover, because face processing might rely on facial configuration, it could be more disrupted by stimulus inversion. Here we report two experiments that compared the rapid categorization of human faces and animals or animal faces in the context of upright and inverted natural scenes. In Experiment 1, the natural scenes contained human faces and animals in a full range of scales from close-up to far views. In Experiment 2, targets were restricted to close-ups of human faces and animal faces. Both experiments revealed the remarkable object processing efficiency of our visual system and further showed (1) virtually no advantage for faces over animals; (2) very little performance impairment with inversion; and (3) greater sensitivity of faces to inversion. These results are interpreted within the framework of a unique system for object processing in the ventral pathway. In this system, evidence would accumulate very quickly and efficiently to categorize visual objects, without involving a face module or a mental rotation mechanism. It is further suggested that rapid object categorization in natural scenes might not rely on high-level features but rather on features of intermediate complexity.},

	abstract = {Given the vast amount of sensory information the brain has to deal with, predicting some of this information based on the current context is a resource-efficient strategy. The framework of predictive coding states that higher-level brain areas generate a predictive model to be communicated via feedback connections to early sensory areas. Here, we directly tested the necessity of a higher-level visual area, V5, in this predictive processing in the context of an apparent motion paradigm. We flashed targets on the apparent motion trace in-time or out-of-time with the predicted illusory motion token. As in previous studies, we found that predictable in-time targets were better detected than unpredictable out-of-time targets. However, when we applied functional magnetic resonance imaging-guided, double-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) over left V5 at 13-53 ms before target onset, the detection advantage of in-time targets was eliminated; this was not the case when {TMS} was applied over the vertex. Our results are causal evidence that V5 is necessary for a prediction effect, which has been shown to modulate V1 activity (Alink et al. 2010). Thus, our findings suggest that information processing between V5 and V1 is crucial for visual motion prediction, providing experimental support for the predictive coding framework. {\textbackslash}copyright The Author 2013.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002221},
	abstract = {The current article suggests that deterministic chaos self-organized in cortical dynamics could be responsible for the generation of spontaneous action sequences. Recently, various psychological observations have suggested that humans and primates can learn to extract statistical structures hidden in perceptual sequences experienced during active environmental interactions. Although it has been suggested that such statistical structures involve chunking or compositional primitives, their neuronal implementations in brains have not yet been clarified. Therefore, to reconstruct the phenomena, synthetic neuro-robotics experiments were conducted by using a neural network model, which is characterized by a generative model with intentional states and its multiple timescales dynamics. The experimental results showed that the robot successfully learned to imitate tutored behavioral sequence patterns by extracting the underlying transition probability among primitive actions. An analysis revealed that a set of primitive action patterns was embedded in the fast dynamics part, and the chaotic dynamics of spontaneously sequencing these action primitive patterns was structured in the slow dynamics part, provided that the timescale was adequately set for each part. It was also shown that self-organization of this type of functional hierarchy ensured robust action generation by the robot in its interactions with a noisy environment. This article discusses the correspondence of the synthetic experiments with the known hierarchy of the prefrontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the primary motor cortex for action generation. We speculate that deterministic dynamical structures organized in the prefrontal cortex could be essential because they can account for the generation of both intentional behaviors of fixed action sequences and spontaneous behaviors of pseudo-stochastic action sequences by the same mechanism. Various psychological observations have suggested that the spontaneously generated behaviors of humans reflect statistical structures extracted via perceptual learning of everyday practices and experiences while interacting with the world. Although those studies have further suggested that such acquired statistical structures use chunking, which generates a variety of complex actions recognized in compositional manner, the underlying neural mechanism has not been clarified. The current neuro-robotics study presents a model prediction for the mechanism and an evaluation of the model through physically grounded experiments on action imitation learning. The model features learning of a mapping from intentional states to action sequences based on multiple timescales dynamics characteristics. The experimental results suggest that deterministic chaos self-organized in the slower timescale part of the network dynamics is responsible for generating spontaneous transitions among primitive actions by reflecting the extracted statistical structures. The robustness of action generation in a noisy physical environment is preserved. These results agree with other neuroscience evidence of the hierarchical organization in the cortex for voluntary actions. Finally, as presented in a discussion of the results, the deterministic cortical dynamics are presumed crucial in generating not only more intentional fixed action sequences but also less intentional spontaneously transitive action sequences.},

In other words, the neural activities in the whole hierarchy settle to a state where the difference between the prediction and the representation of sensory input is minimal.

We investigated the extrapolation of contour shape by human vision. Measurements of extrapolation position and orientation were taken at six distances from the point of occlusion, thereby yielding a detailed representation of the extrapolated contours. Analyses of these measurements revealed that: (i) extrapolation curvature increases linearly with the curvature of the inducing contour, although there is individual bias in the slope; (ii) the precision with which an extrapolated contour is represented is roughly constant, in angular terms, with increasing distance from the point of occlusion; (iii) there is a substantial cost of curvature, in that the overall precision of an extrapolated contour decreases systematically with curvature; (iv) the shapes of visually extrapolated contours are characterized by a nonlinear decrease in curvature, asymptoting to zero; and (v) this decaying pattern of curvature is explained by a Bayesian model in which, with increasing distance from the point of occlusion, the prior tendency to minimize curvature gradually dominates the likelihood tendency to minimize variation in curvature.},

	abstract = {This chapter addresses an open problem in visual motion analysis, the estimation of image motion in the vicinity of occlusion boundaries. With a Bayesian formulation, local image motion is explained in terms of multiple, competing, nonlinear models, including models for smooth (translational) motion and for motion boundaries. The generative model for motion boundaries explicitly encodes the orientation of the boundary, the velocities on either side, the motion of the occluding edge over time, and the appearance/disappearance of pixels at the boundary. We formulate the posterior probability distribution over the models and model parameters, conditioned on the image sequence. Approximate inference is achieved with a combination of tools: A Bayesian filter provides for online computation; factored sampling allows us to represent multimodal non-Gaussian distributions and to propagate beliefs with nonlinear dynamics from one time to the next; and mixture models are used to simplify the computation of joint prediction distributions in the Bayesian filter. To efficiently represent such a high-dimensional space, we also initialize samples using the responses of a low-level motion-discontinuity detector. The basic formulation and computational model provide a general probabilistic framework for motion estimation with multiple, nonlinear models.},

Excitatory connection amplitudes between pairs of cortical neurons vary over two orders of magnitude, comprising only very few strong connections among many weaker ones. Although this highly skewed distribution of connection strengths is observed in diverse cortical areas, its functional significance remains unknown: it is not clear how connection strength relates to neuronal response properties, nor how strong and weak inputs contribute to information processing in local microcircuits. Here we reveal that the strength of connections between layer 2/3 (L2/3) pyramidal neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) obeys a simple rule–the few strong connections occur between neurons with most correlated responses, while only weak connections link neurons with uncorrelated responses. Moreover, we show that strong and reciprocal connections occur between cells with similar spatial receptive field structure. Although weak connections far outnumber strong connections, each neuron receives the majority of its local excitation from a small number of strong inputs provided by the few neurons with similar responses to visual features. By dominating recurrent excitation, these infrequent yet powerful inputs disproportionately contribute to feature preference and selectivity. Therefore, our results show that the apparently complex organization of excitatory connection strength reflects the similarity of neuronal responses, and suggest that rare, strong connections mediate stimulus-specific response amplification in cortical microcircuits.},

	abstract = {The retinal vasculature is the only part of the body's circulatory system that can be observed non-invasively. A large variety of diseases affect the vasculature, in ways that may cause geometrical and functional changes. Retinal images are therefore not only suitable for investigation of ocular diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration ({AMD}), but also for systemic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and arteriosclerosis. This paper presents a novel method for retinal vasculature extraction, using a vessel tracking method based on multi-orientation analysis. We apply multi-orientation analysis via so-called invertible orientation scores, modeling the cortical columns in the visual system of higher mammals. This allows us to successfully deal with the many complex problems inherent to vasculature tracking, such as tracking over crossings, bifurcations, parallel tracks and tracks of varying widths. The method runs fully automatically and provides a detailed model of the retinal vasculature, which is crucial as a sound basis for further quantitative analysis of the retina, especially in screening applications.},

	abstract = {Background: Evidence supports an association between liability to schizophrenia and smooth-pursuit eye movement ({SPEM}) abnormalities. Knowledge of the biological mechanisms of {SPEM} abnormalities may provide critical insights into the etiology of schizophrenia. {SPEM} is elicited by sensory motor information from the movement of the object's image on the retina (retinal motion signal) and subsequent extraretinal motion signals. Previous studies suggest that a deficit in predictive responses to extraretinal motion signals may underlie the {SPEM} phenotype in schizophrenia. Data suggest that at-risk individuals for schizophrenia depend less on extraretinal and more on retinal motion signals to maintain pursuit than healthy individuals. Methods: We designed a pursuit task that employs unexpected changes in target direction during smooth pursuit. The unpredictable task is unique in that performance is expected to be better if the subject's response is biased towards retinal motion. Results: The study included 23 schizophrenia patients and 22 normal controls. Results showed that schizophrenia patients showed significantly superior performance (i.e. higher smooth pursuit gain) for a brief period after an unexpected change in target direction compared with healthy subjects. Conclusion: Findings of superior performance by schizophrenic patients are interesting because they circumvent confounds of generalized deficits. These results provide further evidence of specific deficit in the predictive pursuit mechanism and over-reliance on retinal error signals to maintain pursuit in schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a generalized axiomatic scale-space theory that makes it possible to derive the notions of linear scale-space, affine Gaussian scale-space and linear spatio-temporal scale-space using a similar set of assumptions (scale-space axioms). The notion of non-enhancement of local extrema is generalized from previous application over discrete and rotationally symmetric kernels to continuous and more general non-isotropic kernels over both spatial and spatio-temporal image domains. It is shown how a complete classification can be given of the linear (Gaussian) scale-space concepts that satisfy these conditions on isotropic spatial, non-isotropic spatial and spatio-temporal domains, which results in a general taxonomy of Gaussian scale-spaces for continuous image data. The resulting theory allows filter shapes to be tuned from specific context information and provides a theoretical foundation for the recently exploited mechanisms of shape adaptation and velocity adaptation, with highly useful applications in computer vision. It is also shown how time-causal spatio-temporal scale-spaces can be derived from similar assumptions. The mathematical structure of these scale-spaces is analyzed in detail concerning transformation properties over space and time, the temporal cascade structure they satisfy over time as well as properties of the resulting multi-scale spatio-temporal derivative operators. It is also shown how temporal derivatives with respect to transformed time can be defined, leading to the formulation of a novel analogue of scale normalized derivatives for time-causal scale-spaces. The kernels generated from these two types of theories have interesting relations to biological vision. We show how filter kernels generated from the Gaussian spatio-temporal scale-space as well as the time-causal spatio-temporal scale-space relate to spatio-temporal receptive field profiles registered from mammalian vision. Specifically, we show that there are close analogies to space-time separable cells in the {LGN} as well as to both space-time separable and non-separable cells in the striate cortex. We do also present a set of plausible models for complex cells using extended quasi-quadrature measures expressed in terms of scale normalized spatio-temporal derivatives. The theories presented as well as their relations to biological vision show that it is possible to describe a general set of Gaussian and/or time-causal scale-spaces using a unified framework, which generalizes and complements previously presented scale-space formulations in this area.},

To this end, we compared ocular pursuit of accelerative and decelerative target motion in trials that were presented in random or blocked-order. Catch trials in which target acceleration was unexpectedly modified were randomly interleaved in blocked-order trials. Irrespective of trial order, eye velocity decayed following target occlusion and then recovered towards the different levels of target velocity at reappearance. However, the recovery was better scaled in blocked-order trials than random-order trials. In blocked-order trials only, the reduced gain of smooth pursuit during occlusion was compensated by a change in saccade amplitude and resulted in total eye displacement ({TED}) that was well matched to target displacement. Subsidiary analysis indicated that three repeats of blocked-order trials was sufficient for participants to modify eye displacement compared to that exhibited in random-order trials, although more trials were required before end-occlusion eye velocity was better scaled. Finally, we found that participants exhibited evidence of a scaled response to an unexpected change in target acceleration (i.e., catch trials), although there were also transfer effects from the preceding blocked-order trials. These findings are consistent with the suggestion that on-the-fly prediction (short-term effect) is combined with memorized information from previous trials (long-term effect) to generate a persistent and veridical prediction of occluded target motion.},

	abstract = {Radial frequency ({RF}) patterns are circular contours where the radius is modulated sinusoidally. These stimuli can represent a wide range of common shapes and have been popular for investigating human shape perception. Theories postulate a multistage model where a global contour integration mechanism integrates the outputs of local curvature-sensitive mechanisms. However, studies on how the local contour features are processed have been mostly based on indirect experimental manipulations. Here, we use a novel way to explore the contour integration, using the classification image (a psychophysical reverse-correlation) method. {RF} contours were composed of local elements, and random "radial position noise" offsets were added to element radial positions. We analyzed the relationship between trial-to-trial variations in radial noise and corresponding behavioral responses, resulting in a "shape template": an estimate of the contour parts and features that the visual system uses in the shape discrimination task. Integration of contour features in a global template-like model explains our data well, and we show that observer performance for different shapes can be predicted from the classification images. Classification images show that observers used most of the contour parts. Further analysis suggests linear rather than probability summation of contour parts. Convex forms were detected better than concave forms and the corresponding templates had better sampling efficiency. With sufficient presentation time, we found no systematic preferences for a certain class of contour features (such as corners or sides). However, when the presentation time was very short, the visual system might prefer corner features over side features. {\textbackslash}copyright 2014 {ARVO}.},

We first tested the hypothesis that motion signals are integrated by neurons whose receptive fields ({RFs}) do not move with the eye but stay fixed in the world. Specifically, we measured the {RF} properties of neurons in the middle temporal area ({MT}) of macaques (Macaca mulatta) during the slow phase of optokinetic nystagmus. Using a novel method to estimate {RF} locations for both spikes and local field potentials, we found that the location on the retina that changed spike rates or local field potentials did not change with eye position; {RFs} moved with the eye. Second, we tested the hypothesis that neurons link information across eye positions by remapping the retinal location of their {RFs} to future locations. To test this, we compared {RF} locations during leftward and rightward slow phases of optokinetic nystagmus. We found no evidence for remapping during slow eye movements; the {RF} location was not affected by eye-movement direction. Together, our results show that {RFs} of {MT} neurons and the aggregate activity reflected in local field potentials are yoked to the eye during slow eye movements. This implies that individual {MT} neurons do not integrate sensory information from a single position in the world across eye movements. Future research will have to determine whether such integration, and the construction of perceptual stability, takes place in the form of a distributed population code in eye-centered visual cortex or is deferred to downstream areas.},

Here we show that stimuli of different spatial extents mimicking prey and communication signals cause a switch in the frequency tuning and spike-timing precision of electrosensory pyramidal neurons, resulting in the selective and optimal encoding of both stimulus categories. As in other sensory systems, pyramidal neurons respond only to stimuli located within a restricted region of space known as the classical receptive field ({CRF}). In some systems, stimulation outside the {CRF} but within a non-classical receptive field ({nCRF}) can modulate the neural response to {CRF} stimulation even though {nCRF} stimulation alone fails to elicit responses. We show that pyramidal neurons possess a {nCRF} and that it can modulate the response to {CRF} stimuli to induce this neurobiological switch in frequency tuning.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Functional connectivity analyses of multiple neurons provide a powerful bottom-up approach to reveal functions of local neuronal circuits by using simultaneous recording of neuronal activity. A statistical methodology, generalized linear modeling ({GLM}) of the spike response function, is one of the most promising methodologies to reduce false link discoveries arising from pseudo-correlation based on common inputs. Although recent advancement of fluorescent imaging techniques has increased the number of simultaneously recoded neurons up to the hundreds or thousands, the amount of information per pair of neurons has not correspondingly increased, partly because of the instruments' limitations, and partly because the number of neuron pairs increase in a quadratic manner. Consequently, the estimation of {GLM} suffers from large statistical uncertainty caused by the shortage in effective information. {RESULTS}: In this study, we propose a new combination of {GLM} and empirical Bayesian testing for the estimation of spike response functions that enables both conservative false discovery control and powerful functional connectivity detection. We compared our proposed method's performance with those of sparse estimation of {GLM} and classical Granger causality testing. Our method achieved high detection performance of functional connectivity with conservative estimation of false discovery rate and q values in case of information shortage due to short observation time. We also showed that empirical Bayesian testing on arbitrary statistics in place of likelihood-ratio statistics reduce the computational cost without decreasing the detection performance. When our proposed method was applied to a functional multi-neuron calcium imaging dataset from the rat hippocampal region, we found significant functional connections that are possibly mediated by {AMPA} and {NMDA} receptors. {CONCLUSIONS}: The proposed empirical Bayesian testing framework with {GLM} is promising especially when the amount of information per a neuron pair is small because of growing size of observed network.},

Understandably, most of the associated experimental evidence comes from human or animal electrophysiological studies, allowing direct access to the oscillatory activities. However, such periodicities in perception and attention should, in theory, also be observable using the proper psychophysical tools. Here, we review a number of psychophysical techniques that have been used by us and other authors, in successful and sometimes unsuccessful attempts, to reveal the rhythmic nature of perceptual and attentional processes. We argue that the two existing and largely distinct debates about discrete vs. continuous perception and parallel vs. sequential attention should in fact be regarded as two facets of the same question: how do brain rhythms shape the psychological operations of perception and attention?},

Ongoing cortical activity has been shown to play a critical role in development, and must also be essential for processing sensory perception, because it modulates stimulus-evoked activity, and is correlated with behaviour. Yet its role in the processing of external information and its relationship to internal representations of sensory attributes remains unknown. Using voltage sensitive dye imaging, we previously established a close link between ongoing activity in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cats and the spontaneous firing of a single neuron. Here we report that such activity encompasses a set of dynamically switching cortical states, many of which correspond closely to orientation maps. When such an orientation state emerged spontaneously, it spanned several hypercolumns and was often followed by a state corresponding to a proximal orientation. We suggest that dynamically switching cortical states could represent the brain's internal context, and therefore reflect or influence memory, perception and behaviour.},

We show that the problem reduces to a bifurcation problem in the hyperbolic plane (Poincaré disc). We make use of the concept of a periodic lattice in to further reduce the problem to one on a compact Riemann surface , where Γ is a cocompact, torsion-free Fuchsian group. The knowledge of the symmetry group of this surface allows us to use the machinery of equivariant bifurcation theory. Solutions which generically bifurcate are called ” H-planforms”, by analogy with the ” planforms” introduced for pattern formation in Euclidean space. This concept is applied to the case of an octagonal periodic pattern, where we are able to classify all possible H-planforms satisfying the hypotheses of the Equivariant Branching Lemma. These patterns are, however, not straightforward to compute, even numerically, and in the last section we describe a method for computation illustrated with a selection of images of octagonal H-planforms.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews hierarchical observation models, used in functional neuroimaging, in a Bayesian light. It emphasizes the common ground shared by classical and Bayesian methods to show that conventional analyses of neuroimaging data can be usefully extended within an empirical Bayesian framework. In particular we formulate the procedures used in conventional data analysis in terms of hierarchical linear models and establish a connection between classical inference and parametric empirical Bayes ({PEB}) through covariance component estimation. This estimation is based on an expectation maximization or {EM} algorithm. The key point is that hierarchical models not only provide for appropriate inference at the highest level but that one can revisit lower levels suitably equipped to make Bayesian inferences. Bayesian inferences eschew many of the difficulties encountered with classical inference and characterize brain responses in a way that is more directly predicated on what one is interested in. The motivation for Bayesian approaches is reviewed and the theoretical background is presented in a way that relates to conventional methods, in particular restricted maximum likelihood ({ReML}). This paper is a technical and theoretical prelude to subsequent papers that deal with applications of the theory to a range of important issues in neuroimaging. These issues include; (i) Estimating nonsphericity or variance components in {fMRI} time-series that can arise from serial correlations within subject, or are induced by multisubject (i.e., hierarchical) studies. (ii) Spatiotemporal Bayesian models for imaging data, in which voxels-specific effects are constrained by responses in other voxels. (iii) Bayesian estimation of nonlinear models of hemodynamic responses and (iv) principled ways of mixing structural and functional priors in {EEG} source reconstruction. Although diverse, all these estimation problems are accommodated by the {PEB} framework described in this paper.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an easy to follow tutorial on the free-energy framework for modelling perception developed by Friston, which extends the predictive coding model of Rao and Ballard. These models assume that the sensory cortex infers the most likely values of attributes or features of sensory stimuli from the noisy inputs encoding the stimuli. Remarkably, these models describe how this inference could be implemented in a network of very simple computational elements, suggesting that this inference could be performed by biological networks of neurons. Furthermore, learning about the parameters describing the features and their uncertainty is implemented in these models by simple rules of synaptic plasticity based on Hebbian learning. This tutorial introduces the free-energy framework using very simple examples, and provides step-by-step derivations of the model. It also discusses in more detail how the model could be implemented in biological neural circuits. In particular, it presents an extended version of the model in which the neurons only sum their inputs, and synaptic plasticity only depends on activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons.},

The characterization of the ventral stream as a 'What' pathway is relatively uncontroversial, but the nature of dorsal stream processing is less clear. Originally proposed as mediating spatial perception ('Where'), more recent accounts suggest it primarily serves non-conscious visually guided action ('How'). Here, we identify three pathways emerging from the dorsal stream that consist of projections to the prefrontal and premotor cortices, and a major projection to the medial temporal lobe that courses both directly and indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial processing, including spatial working memory, visually guided action and navigation, respectively.},

	abstract = {In complex networks such as gene networks, traffic systems or brain circuits it is important to understand how long it takes for the different parts of the network to effectively influence one another. In the brain, for example, axonal delays between brain areas can amount to several tens of milliseconds, adding an intrinsic component to any timing-based processing of information. Inferring neural interaction delays is thus needed to interpret the information transfer revealed by any analysis of directed interactions across brain structures. However, a robust estimation of interaction delays from neural activity faces several challenges if modeling assumptions on interaction mechanisms are wrong or cannot be made. Here, we propose a robust estimator for neuronal interaction delays rooted in an information-theoretic framework, which allows a model-free exploration of interactions. In particular, we extend transfer entropy to account for delayed source-target interactions, while crucially retaining the conditioning on the embedded target state at the immediately previous time step. We prove that this particular extension is indeed guaranteed to identify interaction delays between two coupled systems and is the only relevant option in keeping with Wiener's principle of causality. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in detecting interaction delays on finite data by numerical simulations of stochastic and deterministic processes, as well as on local field potential recordings. We also show the ability of the extended transfer entropy to detect the presence of multiple delays, as well as feedback loops. While evaluated on neuroscience data, we expect the estimator to be useful in other fields dealing with network dynamics.},

	abstract = {By varying the noise intensity, we study stochastic spiking coherence (i.e., collective coherence between noise-induced neural spikings) in an inhibitory population of subthreshold neurons (which cannot fire spontaneously without noise). This stochastic spiking coherence may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes. For a coherent case, partially-occupied ” stripes” (composed of spikes and indicating collective coherence) are formed in the raster plot. This partial occupation occurs due to ” stochastic spike skipping” which is well shown in the multi-peaked interspike interval histogram. The main purpose of our work is to quantitatively measure the degree of stochastic spiking coherence seen in the raster plot. We introduce a new spike-based coherence measure M s by considering the occupation pattern and the pacing pattern of spikes in the stripes. In particular, the pacing degree between spikes is determined in a statistical-mechanical way by quantifying the average contribution of (microscopic) individual spikes to the (macroscopic) ensemble-averaged global potential. This ” statistical-mechanical” measure M s is in contrast to the conventional measures such as the ” thermodynamic” order parameter (which concerns the time-averaged fluctuations of the macroscopic global potential), the ” microscopic” correlation-based measure (based on the cross-correlation between the microscopic individual potentials), and the measures of precise spike timing (based on the peri-stimulus time histogram). In terms of M s , we quantitatively characterize the stochastic spiking coherence, and find that M s reflects the degree of collective spiking coherence seen in the raster plot very well. Hence, the ” statistical-mechanical” spike-based measure M s may be used usefully to quantify the degree of stochastic spiking coherence in a statistical-mechanical way.},

	abstract = {For every engineer it goes without saying: in order to build a reliable system we need components that consistently behave precisely as they should. It is also well known that neurons, the building blocks of brains, do not satisfy this constraint. Even neurons of the same type come with huge variances in their properties and these properties also vary over time. Synapses, the connections between neurons, are highly unreliable in forwarding signals. In this paper we argue that both these fact add variance to neuronal processes, and that this variance is not a handicap of neural systems, but that instead predictable and reliable functional behavior of neural systems depends crucially on this variability. In particular, we show that higher variance allows a recurrently connected neural population to react more sensitively to incoming signals, and processes them faster and more energy efficient. This, for example, challenges the general assumption that the intrinsic variability of neurons in the brain is a defect that has to be overcome by synaptic plasticity in the process of learning.},

In contrast to this complexity, neural responses are often characterized through very simple descriptions such as receptive fields or tuning curves. Do these characterizations adequately reflect the true dimensionality reduction that takes place in the nervous system, or are they merely convenient oversimplifications? Here we address this question for the target-selective descending neurons ({TSDNs}) of the dragonfly. Using extracellular multielectrode recordings of a population of {TSDNs}, we quantify the completeness of the receptive field description of these cells and conclude that the information in independent instantaneous position and velocity receptive fields accounts for 70\%-90\% of the total information in single spikes. Thus, we demonstrate that this simple receptive field model is close to a complete description of the features in the stimulus that evoke {TSDN} response.},

Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification.

	abstract = {The development of accurate binocular vision relies on the acquisition of disparity tuning and the calibration of vergence eye movements. Both processes are fundamentally limited by visual acuity, which increases only gradually during the first year of life. Next to limiting performance, however, early limitations of visual acuity may also aid rapid learning analogous to Newport's “less-is-more” hypothesis. Here we use computational modeling to assess the potential impact of early acuity limitations on the development of binocular vision. Our starting point is a previous model of the development of binocular vision, formulated in the Active Efficient Coding framework. We extend this model to incorporate the development of visual acuity between birth and 8 months. We find that the model does in fact learn faster if visual acuity starts out poor and increases with time, supporting the less-is-more hypothesis. Furthermore, we find that the speed of acuity improvement needs to be “just right”, i.e., neither too rapid nor too slow for fastest learning. Overall, our model suggests that early limitations of visual acuity may aid infants in acquiring binocular vision skills and it provides a good starting point for computational modeling of developmental disorders of binocular vision.},

The {VMD}'s concentration parameter and some fitness parameter that will be later defined, have been analyzed in the experimental part for determining their suitability as a image quality assessment measure in some particular distortions such as Gaussian blur or additive Gaussian noise. To achieve such measure, the local Rényi entropy is calculated in four equally spaced orientations and used to determine the parameters of the von Mises distribution of the image entropy. Considering contextual images, experimental results after applying this model show that the best-in-focus noise-free images are associated with the highest values for the von Mises distribution concentration parameter and the highest approximation of image data to the von Mises distribution model. Our defined von Misses fitness parameter experimentally appears also as a suitable no-reference image quality assessment indicator for no-contextual images.},

Recent theoretical and experimental work suggest that this classic distinction between behaviorally and neurally dissociable systems for habitual and goal-directed (or more generally, automatic and controlled) choice may arise from two computational strategies for reinforcement learning ({RL}), called model-free and model-based {RL}, but the cognitive or computational processes by which one system may dominate over the other in the control of behavior is a matter of ongoing investigation. To elucidate this question, we leverage the theoretical framework of cognitive control, demonstrating that individual differences in utilization of goal-related contextual information-in the service of overcoming habitual, stimulus-driven responses-in established cognitive control paradigms predict model-based behavior in a separate, sequential choice task. The behavioral correspondence between cognitive control and model-based {RL} compellingly suggests that a common set of processes may underpin the two behaviors. In particular, computational mechanisms originally proposed to underlie controlled behavior may be applicable to understanding the interactions between model-based and model-free choice behavior.},

Here we exploit the frequent production of microsaccades during ocular fixation in the primate to compare primary visual cortical responses to self-generated motion (real microsaccades) versus motion in the external world (object motion mimicking microsaccades). Real and simulated microsaccades were randomly interleaved in the same viewing condition, thereby producing equivalent oculomotor and behavioural engagement. Our results show that real microsaccades generate biphasic neural responses, consisting of a rapid increase in the firing rate followed by a slow and smaller-amplitude suppression that drops below baseline. Simulated microsaccades generate solely excitatory responses. These findings indicate that V1 neurons can respond differently to internally and externally generated motion, and expand V1's potential role in information processing and visual stability during eye movements.},

In recent years, advancements in such recordings have been extended to include unit activity of an ensemble of neurons. However, a detailed functional characterization of excitatory and inhibitory cells has not been attempted in human neocortex, particularly during the sleep state. Here, we report that such feature discrimination is possible from high-density recordings in the neocortex by using 2D multielectrode arrays. Successful separation of regular-spiking neurons (or bursting cells) from fast-spiking cells resulted in well-defined clusters that each showed unique intrinsic firing properties. The high density of the array, which allowed recording from a large number of cells (up to 90), helped us to identify apparent monosynaptic connections, confirming the excitatory and inhibitory nature of regular-spiking and fast-spiking cells, thus categorized as putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of correlations within each class. A marked exponential decay with distance was observed in the case of excitatory but not for inhibitory cells. Although the amplitude of that decline depended on the timescale at which the correlations were computed, the spatial constant did not. Furthermore, this spatial constant is compatible with the typical size of human columnar organization. These findings provide a detailed characterization of neuronal activity, functional connectivity at the microcircuit level, and the interplay of excitation and inhibition in the human neocortex.},

It is not well understood how these reward effects influence activity in sensory cortices that represent low-level stimulus features. Here, we investigated the effects of reward information in the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We found that the reward value of a stimulus relative to the value of other stimuli is a good predictor of V1 activity. Relative value biases the competition between stimuli, just as has been shown for selective attention. The neuronal latency of this reward value effect in V1 was similar to the latency of attentional influences. Moreover, V1 neurons with a strong value effect also exhibited a strong attention effect, which implies that relative value and top-down attention engage overlapping, if not identical, neuronal selection mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of reward value reach down to the earliest sensory processing levels of the cerebral cortex and imply that theories about the effects of reward coding and top-down attention on visual representations should be unified.},

Such explicit "autonoetic consciousness" is thought to emerge by retrieval of memory of personally experienced events ("episodic memory"). During episodic retrieval, functional imaging studies consistently show differential activity in medial prefrontal and medial parietal cortices. With positron-emission tomography, we here show that these medial regions are functionally connected and interact with lateral regions that are activated according to the degree of self-reference. During retrieval of previous judgments of Oneself, Best Friend, and the Danish Queen, activation increased in the left lateral temporal cortex and decreased in the right inferior parietal region with decreasing self-reference. Functionally, the former region was preferentially connected to medial prefrontal cortex, the latter to medial parietal. The medial parietal region may, then, be conceived of as a nodal structure in self-representation, functionally connected to both the right parietal and the medial prefrontal cortices. To determine whether medial parietal cortex in this network is essential for episodic memory retrieval with self-representation, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation over the region to transiently disturb neuronal circuitry. There was a decrease in the efficiency of retrieval of previous judgment of mental Self compared with retrieval of judgment of Other with transcranial magnetic stimulation at a latency of 160 ms, confirming the hypothesis. This network is strikingly similar to the network of the resting conscious state, suggesting that self-monitoring is a core function in resting consciousness.},

	abstract = {Pairwise correlations among spike trains recorded in vivo have been frequently reported. It has been argued that correlated activity could play an important role in the brain, because it efficiently modulates the response of a postsynaptic neuron. We show here that a neuron's output firing rate critically depends on the higher-order statistics of the input ensemble. We constructed two statistical models of populations of spiking neurons that fired with the same rates and had identical pairwise correlations, but differed with regard to the higher-order interactions within the population. The first ensemble was characterized by clusters of spikes synchronized over the whole population. In the second ensemble, the size of spike clusters was, on average, proportional to the pairwise correlation. For both input models, we assessed the role of the size of the population, the firing rate, and the pairwise correlation on the output rate of two simple model neurons: a continuous firing-rate model and a conductance-based leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. An approximation to the mean output rate of the firing-rate neuron could be derived analytically with the help of shot noise theory. Interestingly, the essential features of the mean response of the two neuron models were similar. For both neuron models, the three input parameters played radically different roles with respect to the postsynaptic firing rate, depending on the interaction structure of the input. For instance, in the case of an ensemble with small and distributed spike clusters, the output firing rate was efficiently controlled by the size of the input population. In addition to the interaction structure, the ratio of inhibition to excitation was found to strongly modulate the effect of correlation on the postsynaptic firing rate.},

	abstract = {The nervous system performs computations to process information that is biologically important. Some of these computations occur in maps–arrays of neurons in which the tuning of neighboring neurons for a particular parameter value varies systematically. Computational maps transform the representation of information into a place-coded probability distribution that represents the computed values of parameters by sites of maximum relative activity. Numerous computational maps have been discovered, including visual maps of line orientation and direction of motion, auditory maps of amplitude spectrum and time interval, and motor maps of orienting movements. The construction of the auditory map of space is the most thoroughly understood: information about interaural delays and interaural intensity differences is processed in parallel by separate computational maps, and the outputs of these maps feed into a higher order processor that integrates sets of cues corresponding to sound source locations and creates a map of auditory space. Computational maps represent ranges of parameter values that are relevant to the animal, and may differentially magnify the representation of values that are of particular importance. The tuning of individual neurons for values of a mapped parameter is broad relative to the range of the map. Consequently, neurons throughout a large portion of a computational map are activated by any given stimulus, and precise information about the mapped parameter is coded by the locations of peak activity. There are a number of advantages of performing computations in maps. First, information is processed rapidly because the computations are preset and are executed in parallel. Second, maps simplify the schemes of connectivity required for processing and utilizing the information. Third, a common, mapped representation of the results of different kinds of computations allows the nervous system to employ a single strategy for reading the information. Finally, maps enable several classes of neuronal mechanisms to sharpen tuning in a manner not possible for information that is represented in a non-topographic code.},

The goal of this study was to gain insight into the decision-making strategy used by human observers in a low-level perceptual task. Data from more than 100 individuals who participated in an auditory-visual spatial localization task was evaluated to examine which of three plausible strategies could account for each observer's behavior the best. This task is very suitable for exploring this question because it involves an implicit inference about whether the auditory and visual stimuli were caused by the same object or independent objects, and provides different strategies of how using the inference about causes can lead to distinctly different spatial estimates and response patterns. For example, employing the commonly used cost function of minimizing the mean squared error of spatial estimates would result in a weighted averaging of estimates corresponding to different causal structures. A strategy that would minimize the error in the inferred causal structure would result in the selection of the most likely causal structure and sticking with it in the subsequent inference of location-"model selection." A third strategy is one that selects a causal structure in proportion to its probability, thus attempting to match the probability of the inferred causal structure. This type of probability matching strategy has been reported to be used by participants predominantly in cognitive tasks. Comparing these three strategies, the behavior of the vast majority of observers in this perceptual task was most consistent with probability matching. While this appears to be a suboptimal strategy and hence a surprising choice for the perceptual system to adopt, we discuss potential advantages of such a strategy for perception.},

However, evidence for neurons that represent motion in depth has been limited, especially in primates, and it is unknown whether such neurons make use of {CD} or {IOVD} cues. We show that approximately one-half of neurons in macaque area {MT} are selective for the direction of motion in depth, and that this selectivity is driven primarily by {IOVD} cues, with a small contribution from the {CD} cue.

	abstract = {1. We measured the responses of 247 neurons recorded from the striate cortex of monkeys and cats as a function of the contrast intensity of luminance-modulated spatial-temporal sine-wave grating patterns to provide a qualitative description and a quantitative mathematical formulation of the contast response function ({CRF}). 2. Qualitatively, it is possible to provide a general description of the contrast response function for the majority of cells as follows: as the luminance contrast of a pattern increases, the response increases in a relatively linear fashion over approximately 50-60s of the response range (generally less than 1 log unit along the contrast range), the slope of the function then begins a rapid compression to an asymptotic maximum-saturation response level. There is, however, a great deal of variation, from cell to cell, in the exact shape and location of the {CRF}. 3. Quantitatively, the responses of each cell were analyzed in terms of the least-squares (parameter optimized) best fit using four different mathematical functions: linear, logarithmic power, and hyperbolic ratio. The results of this procedure showed that, across the range of contrasts measured (1.4- 56\%), the hyperbolic ratio (H ratio) provided the best fit for the vast majority of striate cells: some 70\% of the cells were best fitted by the H ratio and further, averaged across all cells, the H ratio produced the least average residual variance. 4. The contrast response function is an important factor when considering the spa- tial properties of cortical cells; nonlinearities in the {CRF} (compression and saturation) will necessarily influence the spatial tuning. We therefore measured the {CRF} at different spatial frequencies and used the parameters of the H ratio to test the predictions of two general classes of models. If the overall gain, compression, and saturation are set by the absolute response level (response-set gain), then the {CRFs} measured at different fre- quencies should shift horizontally along the contrast axis. Results show that the mea- sured {CRFs} (tested on the same cell using different spatial frequencies) were shifted primarily vertically, suggesting that the gain, compression, and saturation were set by the absolute contrast level (contrast-set gain), relatively independent of spatial frequency; in terms of the H ratio, the semisaturation contrast and the exponent were relatively constant in comparison to the asymptotic saturation response. Thus, the spatial frequency response functions are relatively constant when measured at different stimulus contrasts. 5. There is a great deal of variation in the location of the dynamic response range, from cell to cell, along the contrast axis: some cells distribute their dynamic response range over the first 10\% of contrast, others the second, etc. (relatively independent of preferred spa- tial frequency). One might expect this range variation to be an important factor in behavioral contrast discrimination, To provide an indication of the average population response as a function of contrast, all cells were averaged together (percent response relative to each cell's maximum); the slope of the best-fitting power function (0.77) falls well within the range of estimates found for human psychophysical contrast discrimination functions.},

	abstract = {Deactivation refers to increased neural activity during low-demand tasks or rest compared with high-demand tasks. Several groups have reported that a particular set of brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex, among others, is consistently deactivated. Taken together, these typically deactivated brain regions appear to constitute a default-mode network of brain activity that predominates in the absence of a demanding external task. Examining a passive, block-design sensory task with a standard deactivation analysis (rest epochs vs. stimulus epochs), we demonstrate that the default-mode network is undetectable in one run and only partially detectable in a second run. Using independent component analysis, however, we were able to detect the full default-mode network in both runs and to demonstrate that, in the majority of subjects, it persisted across both rest and stimulus epochs, uncoupled from the task waveform, and so mostly undetectable as deactivation. We also replicate an earlier finding that the default-mode network includes the hippocampus suggesting that episodic memory is incorporated in default-mode cognitive processing. Furthermore, we show that the more a subject's default-mode activity was correlated with the rest epochs (and "deactivated" during stimulus epochs), the greater that subject's activation to the visual and auditory stimuli. We conclude that activity in the default-mode network may persist through both experimental and rest epochs if the experiment is not sufficiently challenging. Time-series analysis of default-mode activity provides a measure of the degree to which a task engages a subject and whether it is sufficient to interrupt the processes–presumably cognitive, internally generated, and involving episodic memory–mediated by the default-mode network.},

The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we prove that if a discrete dictionary reaches a minimal density criterion, then the corresponding discrete {MP} ({dMP}) is equivalent in terms of convergence to a weakened hypothetical continuous {MP}. Interestingly, the corresponding weakness factor depends on a density measure of the discrete dictionary. Second, we show that the insertion of a simple geometric gradient ascent optimization on the atom {dMP} selection maintains the previous comparison but with a weakness factor at least two times closer to unity than without optimization. Finally, we present numerical experiments confirming our theoretical predictions for decomposition of signals and images on regular discretizations of dictionary parametrizations.},

We demonstrate how such a neuronal network with synaptic plasticity can implement a form of Bayesian inference similar to Monte Carlo methods such as particle filtering. Each spike in a higher-layer neuron represents a sample of a particular hidden world state. The spiking activity across the neural population approximates the posterior distribution over hidden states. In this model, variability in spiking is regarded not as a nuisance but as an integral feature that provides the variability necessary for sampling during inference. We demonstrate how the network can learn the likelihood model, as well as the transition probabilities underlying the dynamics, using a Hebbian learning rule.

However, recent studies have reported examples of exceptions, where confidence and accuracy dissociate from each other. Explanations for such dissociations often involve dual-channel models, in which a cortical channel contributes to both accuracy and confidence, whereas a subcortical channel only contributes to accuracy. Here, we show that a single-channel model derived from signal detection theory ({SDT}) can also account for such dissociations. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) to the occipital cortex to disrupt the internal representation of a visual stimulus. The results showed that consistent with previous research, occipital {TMS} decreased accuracy. However, counterintuitively, it also led to an increase in confidence ratings. The data were predicted well by a single-channel {SDT} model, which posits that occipital {TMS} increased the variance of the internal stimulus distributions. A formal model comparison analysis that used information theoretic methods confirmed that this model was preferred over single-channel models, in which occipital {TMS} changed the signal strength or dual-channel models, which assume two different processing routes. Thus our results show that dissociations between accuracy and confidence can, at least in some cases, be accounted for by a single-channel model.},

Surprisingly, we found that higher levels of task-relevant motor variability predicted faster learning both across individuals and across tasks in two different paradigms, one relying on reward-based learning to shape specific arm movement trajectories and the other relying on error-based learning to adapt movements in novel physical environments. We proceeded to show that training can reshape the temporal structure of motor variability, aligning it with the trained task to improve learning. These results provide experimental support for the importance of action exploration, a key idea from reinforcement learning theory, showing that motor variability facilitates motor learning in humans and that our nervous systems actively regulate it to improve learning.},

	abstract = {The variability of neuronal responses is proportional to the mean in many brain areas, which suggests that neural responses might follow a Poisson distribution. In this issue of Neuron, Maimon and Assad document a surprising violation of Poisson firing. Specifically, they show that there are differences in the amount of periodic structure in spike trains across cortical areas, with multimodal sensory areas being more regular than visual areas. Main {TextSince} its earliest descriptions ([Tolhurst et al., 1981] and [Werner and Mountcastle, 1965]) the proportional relationship between the mean and variance of neural responses has been taken as one of the fundamental facts of neural coding, relevant almost anywhere in the brain. Based upon this fact, it has often been assumed that neuronal firing rates are reasonably well described as Poisson. If spike times were distributed as a Poisson process, the time of a spike would not depend on when the previous spike occurred, and the interspike interval ({ISI}) distribution would be exponential. In this issue of Neuron, Maimon and Assad (2009) show that, while this assumption is reasonable for areas {MT} and {MST}, it breaks down for areas 5 and {LIP} of parietal cortex. The Poisson assumption has broad implications for information coding, computation, and ultimately, behavior.While neural responses are often assumed to be approximately Poisson, several features of real neural responses violate the assumptions of this model, and even the mean-variance relationship has been challenged. While this relationship has been shown to hold almost ubiquitously under certain conditions, there are also many conditions under which it breaks down. For example, spike counts in many tasks are measured using relatively large windows, on the order of hundreds of milliseconds or a few seconds, and in this case the mean-variance relation often holds well. The mean-variance relationship does not hold well, however, when using smaller windows for estimating spike counts ([Amarasingham et al., 2006], [Averbeck and Lee, 2003], [de Ruyter van Steveninck et al., 1997] and [Kara et al., 2000]). Thus, whether or not neurons respond in a Poisson-like manner depends on the timescale under consideration. This raises the question of which timescales are relevant in the brain. Relatively flat mean-variance relationships can be seen at less than 100 ms, however, and perceptual and motor systems are likely operating at timescales smaller than this. Other studies have shown that removing behavioral variability (Gur et al., 1997) or using threshold sensory stimulation ({DeWeese} et al., 2003) can also substantially decrease the mean-variance relation.In addition to reliance on bin sizes, three features of neural responses have been shown to contribute to decreasing variability, including the refractory period (Kara et al., 2000), bursting (Barbieri et al., 2001), and temporal correlations in neural responses on longer timescales (Averbeck and Lee, 2003). All of these features can be modeled by including history dependence in spike train prediction. This is, however, a fundamentally non-Poisson feature, as the spike times in a Poisson process would not depend on the history of prior spikes.Maimon and Assad report another fundamental deviation of neural responses from Poisson and they further show that this feature differs across brain areas. They find that the {ISI} distributions are more periodic or pulsed in areas {LIP} and 5 (Figure 1A; blue line) than they are in areas {MT} and {MST} (Figure 1A; red line). This increased regularity also leads to a decrease in the variance of the response for the corresponding mean (Figure 1B; blue dots for regular, red dots for exponential {ISIs}). The fact that this deviation systematically varies across cortical areas suggests a fundamental difference in the way these areas process information and in the organization of the local network or the response properties of the individual neurons. There are a number of strengths to this study, including a series of analyses which show that that this effect does not come about because of bursting, long-refractory periods, the bin size used for the analysis, or microsaccades made by the animals in the task. Furthermore, because the data were collected in an awake, behaving monkey, the effects cannot be ascribed to anesthesia. Thus, this seems to be a fundamental feature of the neural responses that cannot be easily ascribed to previously reported response properties. The implications of this result and related results seen in frontal motor areas (Shinomoto et al., 2003) for coding, computation, and behavior remain to be elucidated. The decrease in variance for a similar mean response would appear to imply increased information coding, because of the increased signal to noise ratio. However, the authors did not find a relation between the regularity of the spike discharge and the coding capacity of individual neurons. Furthermore, information coding in populations depends on other factors that may be independent of the pulsed coding, specifically correlations between neurons in the population (Averbeck et al., 2006), and as such, there is no necessary link between the regularity of the coding in single neurons and the information coded at the population level.Of additional interest for coding is the fact that the single neuron variance decreases in this study as one progresses from sensory to higher-order sensory-motor areas. A previous study in the early visual system has shown increased variability in neural responses as one moves from the sensory periphery to the cortex (Kara et al., 2000), which is consistent with the idea that there is noise added at each stage of sensory processing. The results of the current study seem to suggest a decrease in noise with additional processing steps. While this is interesting, it is not possible to actually increase information coding with additional processing, and as such information cannot increase as one progresses through stages of neural processing. Thus, the increased regularity and decreased variability in the single-cell responses has to be compensated by other factors that decrease or at best maintain information.A second possible implication relates to recent theoretical models of decision-making processes in parietal cortex that rely on Poisson-like variability ([Beck et al., 2008] and [Ma et al., 2006]). Specifically, it has been shown that integrating spikes from neurons with Poisson-like variability can lead to Bayes optimal inference. The results of Maimon and Assad would seem to suggest that the basic assumptions of this decision-making model do not hold well in areas {LIP} and 5. However, the model has been applied to {LIP} integration of {MT} neural responses and Maimon and Assad suggest that the {MT} neurons are more Poisson-like than the {LIP} neurons. Specifically, the linear mean-variance relation holds best in {MT}/{MST}. Furthermore, the theory is somewhat robust to deviations from Poisson-like responses, although it is not clear how robust it is. Thus, it is possible that the increased regularity observed in areas {LIP}/5 is related to downstream inference processes carried out on {MT}/{MST} responses, as the regularity may affect subsequent inference.Maimon and Assad have described a very interesting difference in the regularity of neural responses across brain areas. Perhaps now that we have been exposed to these differences, we will begin seeing them in more data sets and trying to understand what they mean.},

	abstract = {The directional control of smooth pursuit eye movements was studied by presenting human subjects with targets that moved in a straight line at a constant speed and then changed direction abruptly and unpredictably. To minimize the probability of saccadic responses in the interval following the target's change in direction, target position was offset so as to eliminate position error after the reaction time. Smooth pursuit speed declined at a latency of 90 ms, whereas the direction of smooth pursuit began to change later (130 ms). The amplitude of the offset in target position did not affect the subsequent smooth pursuit response. In other experiments, the target's speed or acceleration was changed abruptly at the time of the change in direction. Step changes in speed elicited short-latency responses in smooth pursuit tracking but step changes in acceleration did not. In all instances, the earliest component of the response did not depend on the parameters of the stimulus. The data were fit with a model in which smooth pursuit resulted from the vector addition of two components, one representing a response to the arrest of the initial target motion and the other the response to the onset of target motion in the new direction. This model gave an excellent fit but further analysis revealed nonlinear interactions between the two vector components. These interactions represented directional anisotropies both in terms of the initial tracking direction (which was either vertical or 45 degrees ) and in terms of the cardinal directions (vertical and horizontal).},

	abstract = {In many experiments, control over visual stimulation is obtained by sacrificing much of the complexity of the natural world and visual behavior. For example, stimuli are presented on iso-luminant backgrounds and they are flashed instead of swept into view via saccades. In this experiment, we investigated the influence of complex natural backgrounds and saccades on the development of orientation selectivity in macaque V1. Four conditions were compared: Bars of light were either flashed into the receptive field or brought into the {RF} through a saccade. Different flash and saccade trials were run with iso-luminant gray and natural image backgrounds. Average response amplitudes were usually lower with a natural than gray background. Comparing flash and saccade conditions gave more variable results. From cell-to-cell the flash response was higher or lower than the saccade response. The differences in average response amplitude across conditions appeared to be consistent with gain changes rather than changes in optimal orientation or tuning width. There were also significant effects of the presentation paradigm on the timing of selectivity. Orientation selectivity generally appeared slower with a natural than a gray background. Selectivity usually developed faster when stimuli appeared from a flash rather than a saccade. Comparing the least (flash/gray) and most natural (saccade/natural) paradigms, there was often a significant difference in the timing of maximal selectivity (tens of msec). These results indicate that the more natural paradigms recruit additional neural circuitry that decreases response amplitude and delays orientation selectivity. This suggests that in natural visual situations, the earliest form-selective V1 response carries potentially important information about stimulus context that is different from that available in reduced paradigms.},

This mislocalization is often interpreted in terms of a combination of shifts and deformations of the brain's representation of space to account for the eye movement. Such temporary remapping of positions in space should affect all elements in a scene, leaving ordinal relationships between positions intact. We performed an experiment in which we presented flashes on a background with red and green regions to human subjects. We found that flashes that were presented on the green part of the background around the time of a saccade were readily reported to have been presented on the red part of the background and vice versa. This is inconsistent with the notion of a temporary shift and deformation of perceived space. To explain our results, we present a model that illustrates how temporal uncertainty could give rise to the observed spatial mislocalization. The model combines uncertainty about the time of the flash with a bias to localize targets where one is looking. It reproduced the pattern of mislocalization very accurately, showing that perisaccadic mislocalization can best be explained in terms of temporal uncertainty about the moment of the flash.},

Here, we tested in human observers whether perceptual integration of static motion cues depends on awareness by measuring the capacity to infer the direction of motion implied by a static visible or invisible image under continuous flash suppression. Using measures of directional adaptation, we found that visible but not invisible implied motion adaptors biased the perception of real motion probes. In a control experiment, we found that invisible adaptors implying motion primed the perception of subsequent probes when they were identical (i.e., repetition priming), but not when they only shared the same direction (i.e., direction priming). Furthermore, using a model of visual processing, we argue that repetition priming effects are likely to arise as early as in the primary visual cortex. We conclude that although invisible images implying motion undergo some form of nonconscious processing, visual awareness is necessary to make inferences about motion direction.},

	abstract = {In the past two decades some fundamental properties of cortical connectivity have been discovered: small-world structure, pronounced hierarchical and modular organisation, and strong core and rich-club structures. A common assumption when interpreting results of this kind is that the observed structural properties are present to enable the brain's function. However, the brain is also embedded into the limited space of the skull and its wiring has associated developmental and metabolic costs. These basic physical and economic aspects place separate, often conflicting, constraints on the brain's connectivity, which must be characterized in order to understand the true relationship between brain structure and function. To address this challenge, here we ask which, and to what extent, aspects of the structural organisation of the brain are conserved if we preserve specific spatial and topological properties of the brain but otherwise randomise its connectivity. We perform a comparative analysis of a connectivity map of the cortical connectome both on high- and low-resolutions utilising three different types of surrogate networks: spatially unconstrained ('random'), connection length preserving ('spatial'), and connection length optimised ('reduced') surrogates. We find that unconstrained randomisation markedly diminishes all investigated architectural properties of cortical connectivity. By contrast, spatial and reduced surrogates largely preserve most properties and, interestingly, often more so in the reduced surrogates. Specifically, our results suggest that the cortical network is less tightly integrated than its spatial constraints would allow, but more strongly segregated than its spatial constraints would necessitate. We additionally find that hierarchical organisation and rich-club structure of the cortical connectivity are largely preserved in spatial and reduced surrogates and hence may be partially attributable to cortical wiring constraints. In contrast, the high modularity and strong s-core of the high-resolution cortical network are significantly stronger than in the surrogates, underlining their potential functional relevance in the brain. Macroscopic regions in the grey matter of the human brain are intricately connected by white-matter pathways, forming the extremely complex network of the brain. Analysing this brain network may provide us insights on how anatomy enables brain function and, ultimately, cognition and consciousness. Various important principles of organization have indeed been consistently identified in the brain's structural connectivity, such as a small-world and modular architecture. However, it is currently unclear which of these principles are functionally relevant, and which are merely the consequence of more basic constraints of the brain, such as its three-dimensional spatial embedding into the limited volume of the skull or the high metabolic cost of long-range connections. In this paper, we model what aspects of the structural organization of the brain are affected by its wiring constraints by assessing how far these aspects are preserved in brain-like networks with varying spatial wiring constraints. We find that all investigated features of brain organization also appear in spatially constrained networks, but we also discover that several of the features are more pronounced in the brain than its wiring constraints alone would necessitate. These findings suggest the functional relevance of the 'over-expressed' properties of brain architecture.},

In this commentary, we try to convey the basic ideas behind this perspective, describe their neurophysiologic underpinnings, and highlight the potential importance of this formulation for clinical neuroscience. The formalism it provides-and the implementation of active inference in the brain-may have the potential to reveal aspects of functional neuroanatomy that are compromised in conditions ranging from Parkinson disease to schizophrenia. In particular, many neurologic and neuropsychiatric conditions may be understandable in terms of a failure to modulate the postsynaptic gain of neuronal populations reporting prediction errors during action and perception. From the perspective of the predictive brain, this represents a failure to encode the precision of-or confidence in-sensory information. We propose that the predictive or inferential perspective on brain function offers novel insights into brain diseases. {\textbackslash}copyright 2014 American Academy of Neurology.},

Using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we found that low-level {PEs} about visual stimulus outcome were reflected by widespread activity in visual and supramodal areas but also in the midbrain. In contrast, high-level {PEs} about stimulus probabilities were encoded by the basal forebrain. These findings were replicated in two groups of healthy volunteers. While our {fMRI} measures do not reveal the exact neuron types activated in midbrain and basal forebrain, they suggest a dichotomy between neuromodulatory systems, linking dopamine to low-level {PEs} about stimulus outcome and acetylcholine to more abstract {PEs} about stimulus probabilities.},

To better understand and visualize this alphabet, a representation of motions in the projective plane is used. A further, practical contribution is an interactive tool that allows generating multiple motion patterns and displaying them in various apertures. In our framework, we can explain some well-known results on coherent motion and a few more complex perceptual phenomena such as the 2D–1D entrainment effect, but the focus of this paper is on the methods. Our working hypothesis is that efficient representations can be obtained by suppressing all the redundancies that arise if the visual input does not change in a particular direction, or a set of directions. Finally, we assume that human eye movements will tend to avoid the redundant parts of the visual input and report results where our framework has been used to obtain very good predictions of eye movements made on overlaid natural videos.},

The effect of conditioning motion was still observed when the speeds of the conditioning and test motions did not match. The effect was larger when the conditioning duration was longer, and decayed over time with increased temporal separation between the conditioning and test periods. These results are consistent with the characteristics of motion adaptation on the initial smooth pursuit responses. We also obtained data suggesting that the persistence of the effect depends on visual stimulation in the time between the conditioning and test periods, and that the presence of a stationary visual stimulus facilitates recovery from the motion adaptation.},

	abstract = {In order to understand mechanisms underlying the smooth pursuit abnormality(ies) in schizophrenia, new methods, which independently evaluated predictive smooth pursuit responses to extra-retinal motion signals, were developed and tested. The study compared responses to only extra-retinal motion signals in normal volunteers (n = 25), and individuals with a chronic (n = 21) and a recent onset (n = 18) schizophrenia. Subject groups with chronic schizophrenia and recent onset schizophrenia had significantly poorer predictive pursuit than normal subjects in response to only extra-retinal motion signals. The poor predictive pursuit was evident even at low target velocity when the closed-loop pursuit gain was normal in patients with schizophrenia. Ten of the 18 recent onset patients were drug-free at the time of testing and had no or minimum previous exposure to anti-psychotic medications. Re-analyses of the data showed that on most measures of predictive pursuit, drug-free patients were not significantly different from patients who received anti-psychotic drug treatment. Both patient groups had significantly poorer predictive pursuit than normal subjects. These results suggest that a deficit in processing extra-retinal motion may underlie the abnormal smooth pursuit response in schizophrenia. At low target velocities, patients with schizophrenia were able to compensate for the low extra-retinal gain by increasing the gain of response to the retinal slip velocity. This indicates that patients were able to process retinal slip velocity and generate smooth pursuit eye movements, but experienced a specific deficit in processing and/or integrating extra-retinal motion information for the smooth pursuit response.},

	abstract = {Visually-driven actions and perception are traditionally ascribed to the dorsal and ventral visual streams of the cortical processing hierarchy. However, motion perception and the control of tracking eye movements both depend on sensory motion analysis by neurons in the dorsal stream, suggesting that the same sensory circuits may underlie both action and perception. Previous studies have suggested that multiple sensory modules may be responsible for the perception of low- and high-level motion, or the detection versus identification of motion direction. However, it remains unclear whether the sensory processing systems that contribute to direction perception and the control of eye movements have the same neuronal constraints. To address this, we examined inter-individual variability across 36 observers, using two tasks that simultaneously assessed the precision of eye movements and direction perception: in the smooth pursuit task, observers volitionally tracked a small moving target and reported its direction; in the ocular following task, observers reflexively tracked a large moving stimulus and reported its direction. We determined perceptual-oculomotor correlations across observers, defined as the correlation between each observer's mean perceptual precision and mean oculomotor precision. Across observers, we found that: (i) mean perceptual precision was correlated between the two tasks; (ii) mean oculomotor precision was correlated between the tasks, and (iii) oculomotor and perceptual precision were correlated for volitional smooth pursuit, but not reflexive ocular following. Collectively, these results demonstrate that sensory circuits with common neuronal constraints subserve motion perception and volitional, but not reflexive eye movements.},

	abstract = {It is shown that existing processing schemes of 3D motion perception such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, as well as joint encoding of motion and disparity, do not offer a general solution to the inverse optics problem of local binocular 3D motion. Instead we suggest that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem we derive predictions from two plausible default strategies: (1) the vector normal prefers slow motion in 3D whereas (2) the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in 2D. Predicting perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion provides an opportunity to distinguish between these strategies of 3D motion processing. Our theoretical results suggest that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are needed to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. It seems plausible that motion and disparity input is processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy.},

Despite the diversity of test protocols, 65\% of patients and controls are correctly classified by their overall performance during this pursuit. The smooth pursuit eye movements depend on the ability to anticipate the target's velocity and the visual feedback, as well as on learning and attention. The neuroanatomy implicated in smooth pursuit overlaps to some extent with certain frontal cortex zones associated with some clinical and neuropsychological characteristics of the schizophrenia, therefore some specific components of smooth pursuit anomalies could serve as biomarkers of the disease. Due to their sedative effect, antipsychotics have a deleterious effect on smooth pursuit eye movements, thus these movements cannot be used to evaluate the efficacy of the currently available treatments. {CONCLUSION}: Standardized evaluation of smooth pursuit eye movements on schizophrenia will allow to use specific aspects of that pursuit as biomarkers for the study of its genetics, psychopathology, or neuropsychology.},

We made intraocular injections of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid ({APB}) in adult cats to block visual responses in On-center retinal ganglion cells and examined the consequences on visual responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) of the thalamus. In contrast to current views of retinogeniculate organization, which hold that On-center {LGN} neurons should become silent with {APB}, we find that ∼50\% of On-center neurons rapidly develop Off-center responses. The time course of these emergent responses and the actions of {APB} in the retina indicate the plasticity occurs within the {LGN}. These results suggest there is greater divergence of retinogeniculate connections than previously recognized and that functionally silent, nonspecific retinal inputs can serve as a substrate for rapid plasticity in the adult.},

	abstract = {Sensory information about the outside world is encoded by neurons in sequences of discrete, identical pulses termed action potentials or spikes. There is persistent controversy about the extent to which the precise timing of these spikes is relevant to the function of the brain. We revisit this issue, using the motion-sensitive neurons of the fly visual system as a test case. Our experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual stimuli, comparable to those which flies encounter in free, acrobatic flight. New mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable conclusions about the information content of neural responses even when the set of possible responses is very large. We find that significant amounts of visual information are represented by details of the spike train at millisecond and sub-millisecond precision, even though the sensory input has a correlation time of \${\textbackslash}sim\$55 ms; different patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion trajectories, and the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these trajectories with high precision. Finally, the efficiency of our entropy estimator makes it possible to uncover features of neural coding relevant for natural visual stimuli: first, the system's information transmission rate varies with natural fluctuations in light intensity, resulting from varying cloud cover, such that marginal increases in information rate thus occur even when the individual photoreceptors are counting on the order of one million photons per second. Secondly, we see that the system exploits the relatively slow dynamics of the stimulus to remove coding redundancy and so generate a more efficient neural code.},

	abstract = {How does an infant learn through visual experience to imitate actions of adult teachers, despite the fact that the infant and adult view one another and the world from different perspectives? To accomplish this, an infant needs to learn how to share joint attention with adult teachers and to follow their gaze towards valued goal objects. The infant also needs to be capable of view-invariant object learning and recognition whereby it can carry out goal-directed behaviors, such as the use of tools, using different object views than the ones that its teachers use. Such capabilities are often attributed to ” mirror neurons”. This attribution does not, however, explain the brain processes whereby these competences arise. This article describes the {CRIB} (Circular Reactions for Imitative Behavior) neural model of how the brain achieves these goals through inter-personal circular reactions. Inter-personal circular reactions generalize the intra-personal circular reactions of Piaget, which clarify how infants learn from their own babbled arm movements and reactive eye movements how to carry out volitional reaches, with or without tools, towards valued goal objects. The article proposes how intra-personal circular reactions create a foundation for inter-personal circular reactions when infants and other learners interact with external teachers in space. Both types of circular reactions involve learned coordinate transformations between body-centered arm movement commands and retinotopic visual feedback, and coordination of processes within and between the What and Where cortical processing streams. Specific breakdowns of model processes generate formal symptoms similar to clinical symptoms of autism.},

	abstract = {The firing rates of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are suppressed by large stimuli, an effect known as surround suppression. In cats and monkeys, the strength of suppression is sensitive to orientation; responses to regions containing uniform orientations are more suppressed than those containing orientation contrast. This effect is thought to be important for scene segmentation, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We asked whether it is possible to study these mechanisms in the visual cortex of mice, because of recent advances in technology for studying the cortical circuitry in mice. It is unknown whether neurons in mouse V1 are sensitive to orientation contrast. We measured the orientation selectivity of surround suppression in the different layers of mouse V1. We found strong surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers, part of which was orientation tuned: iso-oriented surrounds caused more suppression than cross-oriented surrounds. Surround suppression was delayed relative to the visual response and orientation-tuned suppression was delayed further, suggesting two separate suppressive mechanisms. Previous studies proposed that surround suppression depends on the activity of inhibitory somatostatin-positive interneurons in the superficial layers. To test the involvement of the superficial layers we topically applied lidocaine. Silencing of the superficial layers did not prevent orientation-tuned suppression in layer 4. These results show that neurons in mouse V1, which lacks orientation columns, show orientation-dependent surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers and that surround suppression in layer 4 does not require contributions from neurons in the superficial layers.},

	abstract = {Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency fluctuations ({\textless} 0.1 Hz), observed in {BOLD} {fMRI} signal during rest, suggest the existence of underlying network dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic brain processes. Furthermore, significant correlations between distinct anatomical regions—or functional connectivity ({FC})—have led to the identification of several widely distributed resting-state networks ({RSNs}). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power fluctuations of local field potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that time-delayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity fluctuations, whose patterns correlate significantly with the empirically measured {FC}. The best agreement of the simulated {FC} with the empirically measured {FC} is found for a set of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated {BOLD} signal between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed {RSNs}. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the large-scale structure of the brain.},

	abstract = {We present a testbed implementation for a foveated robot vision system. To achieve foveation, the visual sensor simulates nonuniform sampling and is mechanically directed toward a specific fixation point. An interest operator is used to select a sequence of fixation points. Successive snapshots of high foveal and low peripheral resolution are combined to create a wide-angle representation of the scene. Such visual processing has been studied with primate and human subjects from a biological point of view. The purpose of this work is to create an active vision system with which we can study foveated machine vision. The current implementation incorporates a {CID} camera positioned by a {PUMA} robot to pan and tilt around a fixed point, a {SIMD} parallel computer, and conventional computers to construct gray-level, edge, and interest maps from several fixations. The system is highly modular, and its architecture permits the efficient incorporation of sequential and parallel components for real-time operation. We demonstrate the modularity of the system and its potential as a testbed for active vision by incorporating two different attentional mechanisms and quantitatively evaluating their performance on artificial and natural images. We propose three types of norms that can be used for this performance evaluation. © 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

	abstract = {Functional brain development is not well understood. In the visual system, neurophysiological studies in nonhuman primates show quite mature neuronal properties near birth although visual function is itself quite immature and continues to develop over many months or years after birth. Our goal was to assess the relative development of two main visual processing streams, dorsal and ventral, using {BOLD} {fMRI} in an attempt to understand the global mechanisms that support the maturation of visual behavior. Seven infant macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were repeatedly scanned, while anesthetized, over an age range of 102 to 1431 days. Large rotating checkerboard stimuli induced {BOLD} activation in visual cortices at early ages. Additionally we used static and dynamic Glass pattern stimuli to probe {BOLD} responses in primary visual cortex and two extrastriate areas: V4 and {MT}-V5. The resulting activations were analyzed with standard {GLM} and multivoxel pattern analysis ({MVPA}) approaches. We analyzed three contrasts: Glass pattern present/absent, static/dynamic Glass pattern presentation, and structured/random Glass pattern form. For both {GLM} and {MVPA} approaches, robust coherent {BOLD} activation appeared relatively late in comparison to the maturation of known neuronal properties and the development of behavioral sensitivity to Glass patterns. Robust differential activity to Glass pattern present/absent and dynamic/static stimulus presentation appeared first in V1, followed by V4 and {MT}-V5 at older ages; there was no reliable distinction between the two extrastriate areas. A similar pattern of results was obtained with the two analysis methods, although {MVPA} analysis showed reliable differential responses emerging at later ages than {GLM}. Although {BOLD} responses to large visual stimuli are detectable, our results with more refined stimuli indicate that global {BOLD} activity changes as behavioral performance matures. This reflects an hierarchical development of the visual pathways. Since {fMRI} {BOLD} reflects neural activity on a population level, our results indicate that, although individual neurons might be adult-like, a longer maturation process takes place on a population level.},

We present a simple compartmental neuron model together with a non-Hebbian, biologically plausible learning rule for dendritic synapses where plasticity is modulated by these three factors. In functional terms, the rule seeks to minimize discrepancies between somatic firings and a local dendritic potential. Such prediction errors can arise in our model from stochastic fluctuations as well as from synaptic input, which directly targets the soma. Depending on the nature of this direct input, our plasticity rule subserves supervised or unsupervised learning. When a reward signal modulates the learning rate, reinforcement learning results.

	abstract = {Interneurons exhibiting centre–surround antagonism within their receptive fields are commonly found in peripheral visual pathways. We propose that this organization enables the visual system to encode spatial detail in a manner that minimizes the deleterious effects of intrinsic noise, by exploiting the spatial correlation that exists within natural scenes. The antagonistic surround takes a weighted mean of the signals in neighbouring receptors to generate a statistical prediction of the signal at the centre. The predicted value is subtracted from the actual centre signal, thus minimizing the range of outputs transmitted by the centre. In this way the entire dynamic range of the interneuron can be devoted to encoding a small range of intensities, thus rendering fine detail detectable against intrinsic noise injected at later stages in processing. This predictive encoding scheme also reduces spatial redundancy, thereby enabling the array of interneurons to transmit a larger number of distinguishable images, taking into account the expected structure of the visual world. The profile of the required inhibitory field is derived from statistical estimation theory. This profile depends strongly upon the signal: noise ratio and weakly upon the extent of lateral spatial correlation. The receptive fields that are quantitatively predicted by the theory resemble those of X-type retinal ganglion cells and show that the inhibitory surround should become weaker and more diffuse at low intensities. The latter property is unequivocally demonstrated in the first-order interneurons of the fly's compound eye. The theory is extended to the time domain to account for the phasic responses of fly interneurons. These comparisons suggest that, in the early stages of processing, the visual system is concerned primarily with coding the visual image to protect against subsequent intrinsic noise, rather than with reconstructing the scene or extracting specific features from it. The treatment emphasizes that a neuron's dynamic range should be matched to both its receptive field and the statistical properties of the visual pattern expected within this field. Finally, the analysis is synthetic because it is an extension of the background suppression hypothesis (Barlow \& Levick 1976), satisfies the redundancy reduction hypothesis (Barlow 1961 a, b) and is equivalent to deblurring under certain conditions (Ratliff 1965).},

However, these networks lack the lateral and feedback connections, and the resulting recurrent neuronal dynamics, of the ventral visual pathway in the human and non-human primate brain. Here we investigate recurrent convolutional neural networks with bottom-up (B), lateral (L), and top-down (T) connections. Combining these types of connections yields four architectures (B, {BT}, {BL}, and {BLT}), which we systematically test and compare. We hypothesized that recurrent dynamics might improve recognition performance in the challenging scenario of partial occlusion. We introduce two novel occluded object recognition tasks to test the efficacy of the models, digit clutter (where multiple target digits occlude one another) and digit debris (where target digits are occluded by digit fragments). We find that recurrent neural networks outperform feedforward control models (approximately matched in parametric complexity) at recognizing objects, both in the absence of occlusion and in all occlusion conditions. Recurrent networks were also found to be more robust to the inclusion of additive Gaussian noise. Recurrent neural networks are better in two respects: (1) they are more neurobiologically realistic than their feedforward counterparts; (2) they are better in terms of their ability to recognize objects, especially under challenging conditions. This work shows that computer vision can benefit from using recurrent convolutional architectures and suggests that the ubiquitous recurrent connections in biological brains are essential for task performance.},

A variety of perceptual phenomena are then discussed, from the point of view of cortical, rather than retinal, topography. It is suggested that the striate cortex may be viewed as a "cyclopean retina" whose non-linear map structure, summarized in terms of a concatenated complex logarithmic pattern, suggests insights into the nature of the Mackay complimentary image, the Frazer spiral, fortification illusions, and the relationship of the second order statistics of a visual stimulus to pre-attentive (textural) segmentation. Finally, the nature of neuronal representation is considered in the context of recent models of perceptual and cognitive function. It is suggested that anatomical re-mapping at successive stages of the {CNS} may provide a conceptual alternative to conventional single cell and connectionist models, and offers a viable approach towards a "field" theory of vision.},

	abstract = {Animal behaviour depends on learning to associate sensory stimuli with the desired motor command. Understanding how the brain orchestrates the necessary synaptic modifications across different brain areas has remained a longstanding puzzle. Here, we introduce a multi-area neuronal network model in which synaptic plasticity continuously adapts the network towards a global desired output. In this model synaptic learning is driven by a local dendritic prediction error that arises from a failure to predict the top-down input given the bottom-up activities. Such errors occur at apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons where both long-range excitatory feedback and local inhibitory predictions are integrated. When local inhibition fails to match excitatory feedback an error occurs which triggers plasticity at bottom-up synapses at basal dendrites of the same pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in a number of tasks and show that it approximates the classical error backpropagation algorithm. Finally, complementing this cortical circuit with a disinhibitory mechanism enables attention-like stimulus denoising and generation. Our framework makes several experimental predictions on the function of dendritic integration and cortical microcircuits, is consistent with recent observations of cross-area learning, and suggests a biological implementation of deep learning.},

An {RPN} is a fully convolutional network that simultaneously predicts object bounds and objectness scores at each position. The {RPN} is trained end-to-end to generate high-quality region proposals, which are used by Fast R-{CNN} for detection. We further merge {RPN} and Fast R-{CNN} into a single network by sharing their convolutional features—using the recently popular terminology of neural networks with 'attention' mechanisms, the {RPN} component tells the unified network where to look.

	abstract = {© 2017 Rankin, Chavane. Voltage-sensitive dye imaging experiments in primary visual cortex (V1) have shown that local, oriented visual stimuli elicit stable orientation-selective activation within the stimulus retinotopic footprint. The cortical activation dynamically extends far beyond the retinotopic footprint, but the peripheral spread stays non-selective—a surprising finding given a number of anatomo-functional studies showing the orientation specificity of long-range connections. Here we use a computational model to investigate this apparent discrepancy by studying the expected population response using known published anatomical constraints. The dynamics of input-driven localized states were simulated in a planar neural field model with multiple sub-populations encoding orientation. The realistic connectivity profile has parameters controlling the clustering of long-range connections and their orientation bias. We found substantial overlap between the anatomically relevant parameter range and a steep decay in orientation selective activation that is consistent with the imaging experiments. In this way our study reconciles the reported orientation bias of long-range connections with the functional expression of orientation selective neural activity. Our results demonstrate this sharp decay is contingent on three factors, that long-range connections are sufficiently diffuse, that the orientation bias of these connections is in an intermediate range (consistent with anatomy) and that excitation is sufficiently balanced by inhibition. Conversely, our modelling results predict that, for reduced global inhibition s trength, spurious orientation selective activation could be generated through long-range lateral connections. Furthermore, if the orientation bias of lateral connections is very strong, or if inhibition is particularly weak, the network operates close to an instability leading to unbounded cortical activation.},

We present a comprehensive framework spanning biological, computational, and cognitive levels, with a clear theoretical continuity between levels, providing a coherent answer directly supported by extensive data at each level. Learning is based on making predictions about what the senses will report at 100 msec (alpha frequency) intervals, and adapting synaptic weights to improve prediction accuracy. The pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus serves as a projection screen upon which predictions are generated, through deep-layer 6 corticothalamic inputs from multiple brain areas and levels of abstraction. The sparse driving inputs from layer 5 intrinsic bursting neurons provide the target signal, and the temporal difference between it and the prediction reverberates throughout the cortex, driving synaptic changes that approximate error backpropagation, using only local activation signals in equations derived directly from a detailed biophysical model. In vision, predictive learning requires a carefully-organized developmental progression and anatomical organization of three pathways (What, Where, and What * Where), according to two central principles: top-down input from compact, high-level, abstract representations is essential for accurate prediction of low-level sensory inputs; and the collective, low-level prediction error must be progressively and opportunistically partitioned to enable extraction of separable factors that drive the learning of further high-level abstractions. Our model self-organized systematic invariant object representations of 100 different objects from simple movies, accounts for a wide range of data, and makes many testable predictions.},

	abstract = {Deep Belief Networks ({DBNs}) have recently shown impressive performance on a broad range of classification problems. Their generative properties allow better understanding of the performance, and provide a simpler solution for sensor fusion tasks. However, because of their inherent need for feedback and parallel update of large numbers of units, {DBNs} are expensive to implement on serial computers. This paper proposes a method based on the Siegert approximation for Integrate-and-Fire neurons to map an offline-trained {DBN} onto an efficient event-driven spiking neural network suitable for hardware implementation. The method is demonstrated in simulation and by a real-time implementation of a 3-layer network with 2694 neurons used for visual classification of {MNIST} handwritten digits with input from a 128x128 Dynamic Vision Sensor ({DVS}) silicon retina, and sensory-fusion using additional input from a 64-channel {AER}-{EAR} silicon cochlea. The system is implemented through the open-source software in the {jAER} project and runs in real-time on a laptop computer. It is demonstrated that the system can recognize digits in the presence of distractions, noise, scaling, translation and rotation, and that the degradation of recognition performance by using an event-based approach is less than 1\%. Recognition is achieved in an average of 5.8 ms after the onset of the presentation of a digit. By cue integration from both silicon retina and cochlea outputs we show that the system can be biased to select the correct digit from otherwise ambiguous input.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that synaptic unreliability is a robust and sufficient mechanism for inducing the stochasticity observed in cortex. Here, we introduce Synaptic Sampling Machines, a class of neural network models that uses synaptic stochasticity as a means to Monte Carlo sampling and unsupervised learning. Similar to the original formulation of Boltzmann machines, these models can be viewed as a stochastic counterpart of Hopfield networks, but where stochasticity is induced by a random mask over the connections. Synaptic stochasticity plays the dual role of an efficient mechanism for sampling, and a regularizer during learning akin to {DropConnect}. A local synaptic plasticity rule implementing an event-driven form of contrastive divergence enables the learning of generative models in an on-line fashion. Synaptic sampling machines perform equally well using discrete-timed artificial units (as in Hopfield networks) or continuous-timed leaky integrate \& fire neurons. The learned representations are remarkably sparse and robust to reductions in bit precision and synapse pruning: removal of more than 75\% of the weakest connections followed by cursory re-learning causes a negligible performance loss on benchmark classification tasks. The spiking neuron-based synaptic sampling machines outperform existing spike-based unsupervised learners, while potentially offering substantial advantages in terms of power and complexity, and are thus promising models for on-line learning in brain-inspired hardware.},

Here we show that a biologically plausible learning rule can train such recurrent networks, guided solely by delayed, phasic rewards at the end of each trial. Networks endowed with this learning rule can successfully learn nontrivial tasks requiring flexible (context-dependent) associations, memory maintenance, nonlinear mixed selectivities, and coordination among multiple outputs. The resulting networks replicate complex dynamics previously observed in animal cortex, such as dynamic encoding of task features and selective integration of sensory inputs. We conclude that recurrent neural networks offer a plausible model of cortical dynamics during both learning and performance of flexible behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The ablation of afferent input results in the reorganization of sensory and motor cortices. In the primary visual cortex (V1), binocular retinal lesions deprive a corresponding cortical region [lesion projection zone ({LPZ})] of visual input. Nevertheless, neurons in the {LPZ} regain responsiveness by shifting their receptive fields ({RFs}) outside the retinal lesions; this re-emergence of neural activity is paralleled by the perceptual completion of disrupted visual input in human subjects with retinal damage. To determine whether V1 reorganization can account for perceptual fill-in, we developed a neural network model that simulates the cortical remapping in V1. The model shows that {RF} shifts mediated by the plexus of spatial- and orientation-dependent horizontal connections in V1 can engender filling-in that is both robust and consistent with psychophysical reports of perceptual completion. Our model suggests that V1 reorganization may underlie perceptual fill-in, and it predicts spatial relationships between the original and remapped {RFs} that can be tested experimentally. More generally, it provides a general explanation for adaptive functional changes following {CNS} lesions, based on the recruitment of existing cortical connections that are involved in normal integrative mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The ability to identify interpretable, low-dimensional features that capture the dynamics of large-scale neural recordings is a major challenge in neuroscience. Dynamics that include repeated temporal patterns (which we call sequences), are not succinctly captured by traditional dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal components analysis ({PCA}) and non-negative matrix factorization ({NMF}). The presence of neural sequences is commonly demonstrated using visual display of trial-averaged firing rates. However, the field suffers from a lack of task-independent, unsupervised tools for consistently identifying sequences directly from neural data, and cross-validating these sequences on held-out data. We propose a tool that extends a convolutional {NMF} technique to prevent its common failure modes. Our method, which we call {seqNMF}, provides a framework for extracting sequences from a dataset, and is easily cross-validated to assess the significance of each extracted factor. We apply {seqNMF} to recover sequences in both a previously published dataset from rat hippocampus, as well as a new dataset from the songbird pre-motor area, {HVC}. In the hippocampal data, our algorithm automatically identifies neural sequences that match those calculated manually by reference to behavioral events. The second data set was recorded in birds that never heard a tutor, and therefore sang pathologically variable songs. Despite this variable behavior, {seqNMF} is able to discover stereotyped neural sequences. These sequences are deployed in an overlapping and disorganized manner, strikingly different from what is seen in tutored birds. Thus, by identifying temporal structure directly from neural data, {seqNMF} can enable dissection of complex neural circuits with noisy or changing behavioral readouts.},

The pathways selective for form and color seem to be derived mainly from the parvocellular geniculate subdivi-sions, the depth-and movement-selective components from the magnocellular. At lower levels, in the retina and in the geniculate, cells in these two subdivisions differ in their color selectivity, contrast sensitivity, temporal prop-erties, and spatial resolution. These major differences in the properties of cells at lower levels in each of the subdivisions led to the prediction that different visual functions, such as color, depth, movement, and form perception, should exhibit corresponding differences. Human perceptual experiments are remarkably consistent with these predictions. Moreover, perceptual experiments can be designed to ask which subdivisions of the system are responsible for particular visual abilities, such as figure/ground discrimination or perception ofdepth from perspective or relative movement-functions that might be diffcult to deduce from single-cell response properties.},

These properties also resemble the spatial receptive fields of neurons in the primary visual cortex of mammals, suggesting that the receptive-field structure of these neurons can be accounted for by a general efficient coding principle. The probabilistic framework provides a method for comparing the coding efficiency of different bases objectively by calculating their probability given the observed data or by measuring the entropy of the basis function coefficients. The learned bases are shown to have better coding efficiency than traditional Fourier and wavelet bases.

	url = {https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08166.pdf},
	abstract = {Neural networks have long been used to solve various problems in ma-chine learning, but apart from a conceptual similarity to cortical structure they stray away from their biological archetypes. Their recent success has prompted many efforts to implement them with more biologically plausible components, but the computational advantages thereof have so far proven elusive. In this work, we focus on two well-established biological facts: spike-based communication between neurons and a limited pool of synap-tic resources (neurotransmitters). We argue that, in combination, these two mechanisms can endow networks with computational capabilities that are otherwise difficult to achieve. In particular, in the context of probabilistic inference, we show how plastic synapses bolster the generative capabili-ties of spiking networks while requiring only a small, local computational overhead, as opposed to the classical tempering solutions for their conven-tional counterparts. Our work thereby highlights important computational consequences of biological features that might otherwise appear as mere engineering limitations or artifacts of evolution. Abstract Spiking networks that perform probabilistic inference have been proposed both as models of cortical computation and as candidates for solving prob-lems in machine learning. However, the evidence for spike-based computa-tion being in any way superior to non-spiking alternatives remains scarce. We propose that short-term plasticity can provide spiking networks with distinct computational advantages compared to their classical counterparts. In this work, we use networks of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that are trained to perform both discriminative and generative tasks in their forward and backward information processing paths, respectively. During training, the energy landscape associated with their dynamics becomes highly di-verse, with deep attractor basins separated by high barriers. Classical algorithms solve this problem by employing various tempering techniques, which are both computationally demanding and require global state up-dates. We demonstrate how similar results can be achieved in spiking networks endowed with local short-term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, we discuss how these networks can even outperform tempering-based ap-proaches when the training data is imbalanced. We thereby show how biologically inspired, local, spike-triggered synaptic dynamics based sim-ply on a limited pool of synaptic resources can allow spiking networks to outperform their non-spiking relatives.},

This paper surveys the application of log-polar imaging in robotic vision, particularly in visual attention, target tracking, egomotion estimation, and 3D perception. The concise yet comprehensive review offered in this paper is intended to provide novel and experienced roboticists with a quick and gentle overview of log-polar vision and to motivate vision researchers to investigate the many open problems that still need solving. To help readers identify promising research directions, a possible research agenda is outlined. Finally, since log-polar vision is not restricted to robotics, a couple of other areas of application are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Tensor methods have emerged as a powerful paradigm for consistent learning of many latent variable models such as topic models, independent component analysis and dictionary learning. Model parameters are estimated via {CP} decomposition of the observed higher order input moments. However, in many domains, additional invariances such as shift invariances exist, enforced via models such as convolutional dictionary learning. In this paper, we develop novel tensor decomposition algorithms for parameter estimation of convolutional models. Our algorithm is based on the popular alternating least squares method, but with efficient projections onto the space of stacked circulant matrices. Our method is embarrassingly parallel and consists of simple operations such as fast Fourier transforms and matrix multiplications. Our algorithm converges to the dictionary much faster and more accurately compared to the alternating minimization over filters and activation maps.},

A novel latent factor model {SLFA} is then proposed as a matrix factorization problem with a special regularization term that encourages collaborative reconstruction. The main benefit (novelty) of the model is that we can simultaneously learn the lower-dimensional representation for data and model the pairwise relationships between latent factors explicitly. An on-line learning algorithm is devised to make the model feasible for large-scale learning problems. Experimental results on two synthetic data and two real-world data sets demonstrate that pairwise relationships and latent factors learned by our model provide a more structured way of exploring high-dimensional data, and the learned representations achieve the state-of-the-art classification performance.},

Unlike {DQN} or Actor-Critic, which are conditional models for a specific reward, using a generative model of the full joint distribution permits the reward to be changed on the fly.

We describe an unsupervised algorithm for learning both localized features and their transformations directly from images using a sparse bilinear generative model. We show that from an arbitrary set of natural images, the algorithm produces oriented basis filters that can simultaneously represent features in an image and their transformations. The learned generative model can be used to translate features to different locations, thereby reducing the need to learn the same feature at multiple locations, a limitation of previous approaches to sparse coding and {ICA}. Our results suggest that by explicitly modeling the interaction between local image features and their transformations, the sparse bilinear approach can provide a basis for achieving transformation-invariant vision.},

We test the model using eye movement data from a human action observation study. In both the human study and our model, saccades are proactive whenever context affords accurate action prediction; but uncertainty induces a more reactive gaze strategy, via tracking the observed movements.

	abstract = {In order to understand how the mammalian neocortex is performing computations, two things are necessary; we need to have a good understanding of the available neuronal processing units and mechanisms, and we need to gain a better understanding of how those mechanisms are combined to build functioning systems. Therefore, in recent years there is an increasing interest in how spiking neural networks ({SNN}) can be used to perform complex computations or solve pattern recognition tasks. However, it remains a challenging task to design {SNNs} which use biologically plausible mechanisms (especially for learning new patterns), since most of such {SNN} architectures rely on training in a rate-based network and subsequent conversion to a {SNN}. We present a {SNN} for digit recognition which is based on mechanisms with increased biological plausibility, i.e. conductance-based instead of current-based synapses, spike-timing-dependent plasticity with time-dependent weight change, lateral inhibition, and an adaptive spiking threshold. Unlike most other systems, we do not use a teaching signal and do not present any class labels to the network. Using this unsupervised learning scheme, our architecture achieves 95\% accuracy on the {MNIST} benchmark, which is better than previous {SNN} implementations without supervision. The fact that we used no domain-specific knowledge points toward the general applicability of our network design. Also, the performance of our network scales well with the number of neurons used and shows similar performance for four different learning rules, indicating robustness of the full combination of mechanisms, which suggests applicability in heterogeneous biological neural networks.},

	abstract = {It has long been conjectured that hypotheses spaces suitable for data that is compositional in nature, such as text or images, may be more efficiently represented with deep hierarchical networks than with shallow ones. Despite the vast empirical evidence supporting this belief, theoretical justifications to date are limited. In particular, they do not account for the locality, sharing and pooling constructs of convolutional networks, the most successful deep learning architecture to date. In this work we derive a deep network architecture based on arithmetic circuits that inherently employs locality, sharing and pooling. An equivalence between the networks and hierarchical tensor factorizations is established. We show that a shallow network corresponds to {CP} (rank-1) decomposition, whereas a deep network corresponds to Hierarchical Tucker decomposition. Using tools from measure theory and matrix algebra, we prove that besides a negligible set, all functions that can be implemented by a deep network of polynomial size, require exponential size in order to be realized (or even approximated) by a shallow network. Since log-space computation transforms our networks into {SimNets}, the result applies directly to a deep learning architecture demonstrating promising empirical performance. The construction and theory developed in this paper shed new light on various practices and ideas employed by the deep learning community.},

Asynchronous event-based neuromorphic retinas are composed of autonomous pixels, each of them asynchronously generating "spiking" events that encode relative changes in pixels' illumination at high temporal resolutions. The optical flow is computed at each event, and is integrated locally or globally in a speed and direction coordinate frame based grid, using speed-tuned temporal kernels. The latter ensures that the resulting feature equitably represents the distribution of the normal motion along the current moving edges, whatever their respective dynamics.

Intracellular recordings in cat area 17 show that the visually evoked synaptic integration field extends over a much larger area than that established on the basis of spike activity. Synaptic depolarizing (dominant excitation) decreases in strength for stimuli that are flashed at increasing distances away from the centre of the discharge field, while their onset latency increases. A detailed spatio-temporal analysis of these electrophysiological data shows that subthreshold synaptic responses observed in the 'silent' surround of cortical receptive fields result from the intracortical spread of activation waves carried by slowly conducting horizontal axons within primary visual cortex. They also predict that a perceptual facilitation may occur when feedforward activation produced by the motion signal in the retina travels in phase in the primary visual cortex with the visually induced spread of horizontal activation. A psychophysical correlate has been obtained in humans, showing that apparent motion produced by a sequence of co-linear Gabor patches, known to preferentially activate V1 orientation selective cells, are perceived by human observers as much faster than non co-linear sequences of the same physical speed. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	abstract = {A central goal in theoretical neuroscience is to predict the response properties of sensory neurons from first principles. Several theories have been proposed to this end. " Efficient coding " posits that neural circuits maximise information encoded about their inputs. " Sparse coding " posits that individual neurons respond selectively to spe-cific, rarely occurring, features. Finally, " predictive coding " posits that neurons preferentially encode stimuli that are useful for making predictions. Except in special cases, it is unclear how these theories relate to each other, or what is expected if different coding objec-tives are combined. To address this question, we developed a unified framework that encompasses these previous theories and extends to new regimes, such as sparse predictive coding. We explore cases when different coding objectives exert conflicting or synergistic ef-fects on neural response properties. We show that predictive coding can lead neurons to either correlate or decorrelate their inputs, de-pending on presented stimuli, while (at low-noise) efficient coding always predicts decorrelation. We compare predictive versus sparse coding of natural movies, showing that the two theories predict qual-itatively different neural responses to visual motion. Our approach promises a way to explain the observed diversity of sensory neural responses, as due to a multiplicity of functional goals performed by different cell types and/or circuits. S ensory neural circuits perform a myriad of computations, which allow us to make sense of, and interact with, our en-vironment. For example, neurons in the primary visual cortex encode information about local edges in an image [1], while neurons in higher-level areas encode more complex features, such as textures or faces [2, 3]. A central aim of sensory neu-roscience is to develop a mathematical theory to explain the purpose and nature of such computations, and, ultimately, predict neural responses to stimuli from first principles. Several theories have been proposed about the function that sensory systems have evolved to perform. The efficient coding hypothesis posits that sensory circuits transmit maximal in-formation about their inputs, given internal constraints, such as metabolic costs and/or noise [4, 5, 6, 7]. Alternatively, the sparse coding hypothesis posits that individual neurons re-spond selectively to specific, rarely occurring, features in the environment [8, 9, 10]. Finally, the more recent predictive cod-ing hypothesis 1 posits that sensory neurons transmit maximal information about stimuli that are predictive about the future while discarding non-predictive information [11, 12]. One may ask which, if any, of these objectives are fulfilled by sensory neural circuits. This question is all the more impor-tant given that, in many cases, different coding objectives ap-pear to directly conflict with each other. For example, a classic result of efficient coding in the low-noise regime is that neurons should temporally decorrelate their inputs and preferentially encode fast stimulus features [13, 14, 15, 16]. In contrast, pre-dictive coding favours the extraction of temporally-correlated, slow features [17, 18]. Likewise, sparse coding requires that neurons respond selectively to a single, preferred stimulus fea-ture. It is unclear if this is compatible with predictive coding, which requires neurons to respond to stimuli as quickly as possible. While a large body of theoretical work exists on efficient and sparse coding (reviewed in [19, 20]), there is little work on how neurons could optimally encode stimuli that are pre-dictive about the future (with the exception of [21, 17]); in short, the general implications of predictive coding for neural circuits are still unknown. We also do not understand how dif-ferent coding objectives relate to each other, or what happens when they are combined. Here, we incorporate the three existing theories—sparse coding, efficient coding, and predictive coding—into a unified framework. In this framework, a small set of optimisation pa-rameters determines the functional goals and constraints faced by sensory neurons. Previous theories correspond to specific values of these optimisation parameters. As a result, we can investigate the conditions under which different coding objec-tives, such as encoding predictive information versus maximis-ing efficiency, have conflicting or synergistic effects on neural responses. Further, we can explore qualitatively new coding regimes, such as neural codes that are both predictive and sparse. We end by hypothesizing that the observed diversity of sensory neural responses spans the space of coding tradeoffs accessible by varying the parameters of our new theory.},

The associative plasticity rules demonstrated in vitro, mostly in silent networks, are based on the detection of correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity and hence are sensitive to spontaneous activity and spurious correlations. Therefore, they cannot operate in realistic network states. Here, we present a new class of spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rules with local floating plasticity thresholds, the slow dynamics of which account for metaplasticity. This novel algorithm is shown to both correctly predict homeostasis in synaptic weights and solve the problem of asymptotic stable learning in noisy states. It is shown to naturally encompass many other known types of learning rule, unifying them into a single coherent framework. The mixed presynaptic and postsynaptic dependency of the floating plasticity threshold is justified by a cascade of known molecular pathways, which leads to experimentally testable predictions.},

	abstract = {We consider the class of iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithms ({ISTA}) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods, which can be viewed as an ex- tension of the classical gradient algorithm, is attractive due to its simplicity and thus is adequate for solving large-scale problems even with dense matrix data. However, such methods are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a new fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm ({FISTA}) which preserves the computational simplicity of {ISTA} but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising nu- merical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of {FISTA} which is shown to be faster than {ISTA} by several orders of magnitude. Key},

	abstract = {Log-polar imaging is a kind of foveal, biologically inspired visual representation with advantageous properties in practical applications in computer vision, robotics, and other fields. While the cheapest, most flexible, and most common approach to get log-polar images is to use software-based mappers, this solution entails a cost which prevents certain experiments or applications from being feasible. This may be the case in some real-time (robotic) applications and, in general, when the conversion cost is not affordable for the task at hand. To overcome this drawback and make log-polar imaging more generally available, parallel solutions with affordable modern multi-core architectures have been devised, implemented, and tested in this work. Experimental results reveal that speed-up factors as high as or higher than 10 or 20, depending on the configuration, are possible to get log-polar images from large gray-level or color cartesian images using commodity graphics processors. Remarkable speedups are also reported for current multi-core processors. This noteworthy performance allows visual tasks that would otherwise be unthinkable with sequential implementations to become feasible. Additionally, since three different approaches have been explored and compared in terms of several criteria, different cost-effective choices are advisable depending on different visual task requirements or hardware availability.},

Aligning retinotopic maps to architectonic borders, we found a mismatch in border location, indicating that architectonic borders are not aligned with the retinotopic transition at the vertical meridian. We also assessed the representation of visual space within each region, finding that four visual areas bordering V1 ({LM}, P, {PM} and {RL}) display complementary representations, with overlap primarily at the central hemifield.

The rapid detection of animals in a scene is one compelling example of this phenomenon, and it suggests the automatic processing of at least some types of categories with little or no attentional requirements (Li et al., 2002;2005). The aim of this study is to investigate whether the remarkable capability to categorize complex natural scenes exist in the absence of awareness, based on recent reports that “invisible” stimuli, which do not reach conscious awareness, can still be processed by the human visual system (Pasley et al., 2004;Williams et al., 2004;Fang and He, 2005;Jiang et al., 2006;Jiang et al., 2007;Kaunitz et al., 2011a). In two experiments we recorded {ERPs} in response to animal and non-animal/vehicle stimuli in both aware and unaware conditions in a continuous flash suppression ({CFS}) paradigm. Our results indicate that even in the “unseen” condition, the brain responds differently to animal and non-animal/vehicle images, consistent with rapid activation of animal-selective feature detectors prior to, or outside of, suppression by the {CFS} mask.},

Our interest lies in empirically evaluating the expressiveness and the learnability of {LSTMs} in the sequence-to-sequence regime by training them to evaluate short computer programs, a domain that has traditionally been seen as too complex for neural networks. We consider a simple class of programs that can be evaluated with a single left-to-right pass using constant memory. Our main result is that {LSTMs} can learn to map the character-level representations of such programs to their correct outputs. Notably, it was necessary to use curriculum learning, and while conventional curriculum learning proved ineffective, we developed a new variant of curriculum learning that improved our networks' performance in all experimental conditions. The improved curriculum had a dramatic impact on an addition problem, making it possible to train an {LSTM} to add two 9-digit numbers with 99\% accuracy.},

However, it remains unclear whether this anatomical stereotypy implies functional homogeneity, or whether instead different cortical areas are specialized to process the diverse sensory inputs they receive. Here we have used a two alternative forced choice task to assess modality-specific differences in the ability of rats to exploit precise neuronal timing. We delivered pairs of electrical pulses directly to different areas of cortex to determine the minimum timing differences subjects could detect. By stimulating the cortex directly, we isolated differences due to cortical circuitry rather than to sensory transduction and subcortical processing. Surprisingly, the minimum detectable timing differences varied over more than an order of magnitude, ranging from 1 ms in barrel cortex to 15 ms in visual cortex. Furthermore, these modality-specific differences depended upon sensory experience: although animals subjected to whisker clipping initially showed an impaired ability to exploit fine timing in barrel cortical stimulation, behavioral training partially rescued this deficit. Our results suggest that different cortical areas are adapted to the specific structure of the input signals they process, and that precise spike timing may play a more important role for some cortical areas than for others.},

	abstract = {Neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and brain imaging studies have helped to shed light on how the brain transforms raw sensory information into a form that is useful for goal-directed behavior. A fundamental question that is seldom addressed by these studies, however, is why the brain uses the types of representations it does and what evolutionary advantage, if any, these representations confer. It is difficult to address such questions directly via animal experiments. A promising alternative is to use probabilistic principles such as maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference to derive models of brain function.This book surveys some of the current probabilistic approaches to modeling and understanding brain function. Although most of the examples focus on vision, many of the models and techniques are applicable to other modalities as well. The book presents top-down computational models as well as bottom-up neurally motivated models of brain function. The topics covered include Bayesian and information-theoretic models of perception, probabilistic theories of neural coding and spike timing, computational models of lateral and cortico-cortical feedback connections, and the development of receptive field properties from natural signals.},

We analytically derived the optimal tuning curve of a single neuron encoding a one-dimensional stimulus with an arbitrary input distribution.

Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging {\textgreater}100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

	title = {Bayesian Modeling of Motion Perception using Dynamical Stochastic Textures},
	abstract = {A common practice to account for psychophysical biases in vision is to frame them as consequences of a dynamic process relying on optimal inference with respect to a generative model. The present study details the complete formulation of such a gen-erative model intended to probe visual motion perception. It is first derived in a set of axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We then extend previous con-tributions by detailing three equivalent formulations of the Gaussian dynamic texture model. First, the composite dynamic textures are constructed by the random aggrega-tion of warped patterns, which can be viewed as 3D Gaussian fields. Second, these textures are cast as solutions to a stochastic partial differential equation ({sPDE}). This essential step enables real time, on-the-fly, texture synthesis using time-discretized auto-regressive processes. It also allows for the derivation of a local motion-energy model, which corresponds to the log-likelihood of the probability density. The log-likelihoods are finally essential for the construction of a Bayesian inference framework. We use the model to probe speed perception in humans psychophysically using zoom-like changes in stimulus spatial frequency content. The likelihood is contained within the genera-tive model and we chose a slow speed prior consistent with previous literature. We then validated the fitting process of the model using synthesized data. The human data replicates previous findings that relative perceived speed is positively biased by spatial frequency increments. The effect cannot be fully accounted for by previous models, but the current prior acting on the spatio-temporal likelihoods has proved necessary in accounting for the perceptual bias.},

	abstract = {In this study we quantify the influence of adaptation luminance on the threshold for direction-detection in coherently moving random-pixel arrays ({RPAs}). Square {RPAs} of a constant rms-contrast (35\%) were used and we determined their ‘critical' or threshold-width Wc. Mean retinal illuminances were varied in 13 steps of 0.5 log unit from the low photopic range (screen luminance 0.3 cd/m2) down to 6 log units attenuation, which appeared to be about the absolute threshold of vision under the conditions of our experiment. Moving {RPAs} were presented at six retinal locations (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48°) from the fovea to the far periphery in the temporal visual field of the right eye of three experienced observers (the authors). In order to ensure an honest comparison between these very disparate conditions, the spatial dimensions (including speed) were scaled according to the acuity, as measured separately for each of the viewing-conditions and observers. Acuity scaling proves to equate the performance for all eccentricities and luminance levels rather well. The fovea is special, but only in the sense that the absolute threshold for light detection is reached earlier than in peripheral regions. In all other respects foveal results follow the pattern found for peripheral locations. Two different regimes can be discerned in the data, one for high and one for low speeds. In the low speed range Wc is almost constant, regardless of luminance level or eccentricity. The critical ‘crossing-time' Tc for any pixel starting at one end of the stimulus and leaving at the opposite end is therefore inversely proportional to velocity in the low-speed range (time–velocity reciprocity). At medium-to-high speeds Wc increases linearly with velocity, so Tc is constant. This constant (minimum) value of Tc differs between subjects, but in all subjects it increases somewhat with decreasing luminance level, even for our acuity-scaled stimuli. The different behaviour for low and high speeds [reported before for photopic viewing conditions by van de Grind, W. A., van Doorn, A. J., \& Koenderink, J. J. (1983. Journal of the Optical Society of America, 73, 1674–1683) and van de Grind, W. A., Koenderink, J. J., \& van Doorn A. J. (1986. Vision Research, 26, 797–810)] proves to hold from photopic to low scotopic luminance ranges, provided the stimuli are scaled according to acuity. We draw the general conclusion that movement detection is a very robust process that tolerates extremely low retinal illuminance levels. Moreover, the visual system appears to use the same processing principles in combination with an acuity-scaled architecture under all adaptation states and at all eccentricities.},

Here we investigate how neurons located along the progression of extrastriate areas that, in the rat brain, run laterally to primary visual cortex, encode object information. We found a progressive functional specialization of neural responses along these areas, with: (1) a sharp reduction of the amount of low-level, energy-related visual information encoded by neuronal firing; and (2) a substantial increase in the ability of both single neurons and neuronal populations to support discrimination of visual objects under identity-preserving transformations (e.g., position and size changes). These findings strongly argue for the existence of a rat object-processing pathway, and point to the rodents as promising models to dissect the neuronal circuitry underlying transformation-tolerant recognition of visual objects.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Visual tracking is a process in which the location of one or several objects is estimated in a video sequence based on their appearance. High diversity of states and conditions of a moving stimulus and the existence of abundant challenges such as a cluttered background, variations in the objects appearance, and occlusion make this problem very complicated. Although a wide range of diverse algorithms have been introduced in this field, even the state-of-art ones have not been able to achieve high accuracy in facing different challenges of this problem. Nevertheless, by observing the biological world and paying attention to the living beings, particularly humans, it is revealed that the biological visual system performs the visual tracking task ideally. Therefore, inspiring from this biological system and especially its spatiotemporal processing, motion perception, attention, and saliency mechanism, in this paper a new biologically inspired visual tracking framework is proposed. The suggested framework includes a six-phase process in which the executive blocks, their connections, and information flow among them are inspired by the visual cortex. Using visual features extracted in primary layers of the visual cortex as well as the local-global and sparse representation of the object of interest make possible to employ the proposed framework in different conditions. In this paper, the theory of the suggested framework and its biological background is explained. Investigating the procedure of proposed framework from the viewpoint of employed features, spatiotemporal process, and the quiddity of local-global processing indicated that this framework enjoys the ability to manage most of the mentioned challenges, and can robustly track the object of interest in real conditions and application. This paper seeks to bridge biological and machine visions in order to bring the robustness, speed, and accuracy of biological vision into the artificial intelligence world.},

A drifting (or counterphasing) sinusoidal grating was used as the stimulus in a study in which we parametrically varied {SF} between 0.4 and 7 cycles/degree and {TF} between 0 and 18 Hz. For each experiment we constructed {fMRI} amplitude tuning curves, averaged across subjects, for each visual area. The tuning curves that resulted are consistent with the known physiological properties of cells in the corresponding macaque visual areas, previous functional imaging studies, and in the case of V1, the psychophysically determined contrast sensitivity functions for spatial and temporal frequency. In the case of V3A, the {SF} tuning functions obtained were more similar to those found in single cell studies of macaque V3 rather than macaque V3A. All areas showed at least a moderate preference for directed versus counterphasing motion with V5 showing the largest preference.

	abstract = {The "aperture problem" indicates that a local reading of the velocity of an oriented contour is inherently ambiguous, insufficient by itself to recover the velocity of image points. In Wallach's "barber pole" display consisting of moving diagonal lines within an elongated rectangular aperture, it has been suggested that the unambiguous motion of edge-terminators along the longer edges of the aperture propagates towards the motion-ambiguous center part of drifting stripes. This results in the perception of a surface moving in the direction of the longer axis of the aperture. By manipulating the stereoscopic disparity of a striped pattern relative to the aperture plane, we found that the disambiguating effects of terminators could be abolished if the striped pattern was in uncrossed disparity relative to the aperture plane. Also, the motion in 3 separate horizontally oriented, and vertically aligned apertures which would otherwise be seen as moving horizontally, was seen as "linked" together and moving vertically. This occurred only when the horizontally oriented segments separating these apertures were stereoscopically coded so that they appeared as occluders in front. These findings suggest that accidental or "extrinsic" terminators created by occluding edges are treated differently from real or "intrinsic" terminators, and that the real-world constraint of occlusion is thus implemented in the ambiguity-solving processes for motion. ?? 1989.},

	abstract = {Humans can rapidly recognize a multitude of objects despite differences in their appearance. The neural mechanisms that endow high-level sensory neurons with both selectivity to complex stimulus features and "tolerance" or invariance to identity-preserving transformations, such as spatial translation, remain poorly understood. Previous studies have demonstrated that both tolerance and selectivity to conjunctions of features are increased at successive stages of the ventral visual stream that mediates visual recognition. Within a given area, such as visual area V4 or the inferotemporal cortex, tolerance has been found to be inversely related to the sparseness of neural responses, which in turn was positively correlated with conjunction selectivity. However, the direct relationship between tolerance and conjunction selectivity has been difficult to establish, with different studies reporting either an inverse or no significant relationship. To resolve this, we measured V4 responses to natural scenes, and using recently developed statistical techniques, we estimated both the relevant stimulus features and the range of translation invariance for each neuron. Focusing the analysis on tuning to curvature, a tractable example of conjunction selectivity, we found that neurons that were tuned to more curved contours had smaller ranges of position invariance and produced sparser responses to natural stimuli. These trade-offs provide empirical support for recent theories of how the visual system estimates 3D shapes from shading and texture flows, as well as the tiling hypothesis of the visual space for different curvature values.},

Intriligator, J. Rivest, \& P. Cavanagh, 2004). We explored the possibility of a link between this and signal intensity reductions at low levels of visual processing. In Experiment 1, we used Troxler fading as a metric of signal {intensityVthe} apparent fading of a stimulus with prolonged viewing (I. P. V. Troxler, 1804). Fading was exaggerated by presenting oddball and standard stimuli to different eyes. However, there was no fading difference when standard stimuli were presented persistently or intermittently. These results contrast with oddball effects, which were insensitive to eye of origin, and which were contingent on intermittent standard stimuli. In Experiment 2, we show that oddball effects can be elicited with oddballs that are less intense versions of repetitive stimuli, and in Experiment 3, we show that oddball effects can scale with the discrepancy between repeated and oddball stimuli. These observations discredit any oddball effect explanation predicated on low-level neural response magnitudes to individual stimuli. Instead, our data support the view that oddball effects are driven by predictive coding (V. Pariyadath \& D. Eagleman, 2007), reflecting the discrepancy between expected and actual inputs.},

These perceptual aftereffects have provided invaluable tools with which to study the mechanisms of motion adaptation and draw inferences about the properties of underlying neural populations. Behavioral studies of the time course of motion aftereffects typically reveal a gradual process of adaptation spanning a period of multiple seconds. In contrast, neurophysiological studies have documented multiple motion adaptation effects operating over similar, or substantially faster (i.e., sub-second) time scales. Here we investigated motion adaptation by measuring time-dependent changes in the ability of moving stimuli to distort the perceived position of briefly presented static objects. The temporal dynamics of these motion-induced spatial distortions reveal the operation of two dissociable mechanisms of motion adaptation with differing properties. The first is rapid (subsecond), acts to limit the distortions induced by continuing motion, but is not sufficient to produce an aftereffect once the motion signal disappears. The second gradually accumulates over a period of seconds, does not modulate the size of distortions produced by continuing motion, and produces repulsive aftereffects after motion offset. These results provide new psychophysical evidence for the operation of multiple mechanisms of motion adaptation operating over distinct time scales.},

We have now come closer to describing such a link by taking the direction of synaptic transmission into account, constructing graphs of a network that reflect the direction of information flow, and analyzing these directed graphs using algebraic topology. Applying this approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence towards peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.},

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: Since the discovery of neurons selective for pattern motion direction in primate middle temporal area {MT} (Albright, 1984;Movshon et al., 1985), the neural computation of this signal has been the subject of intense study. The bulk of this work has explored responses to plaids obtained by summing two drifting sinusoidal gratings. Unfortunately, with these stimuli, many different mechanisms are similarly effective at extracting pattern motion. We devised a new set of stimuli, obtained by summing two random line stimuli with different orientations. This allowed several novel manipulations, including generating plaids that do not contain rigid 2D motion. Importantly, these stimuli do not engage most of the previously proposed mechanisms. We then recorded the ocular following responses that such stimuli induce in human subjects. We found that pattern motion is computed even with stimuli that do not cohere perceptually, including those without rigid motion, and even when the two gratings are presented separately to the two eyes. Moderate temporal and/or spatial separation of the gratings impairs the computation. We show that, of the models proposed so far, only those based on the intersection-of-constraints rule, embedding a motion-from-form mechanism (in which orientation signals are used in the computation of motion direction signals), can account for our results. At least for the eye movements reported here, a motion-from-form mechanism is thus involved in one of the most basic functions of the visual motion system: extracting motion direction from complex scenes. {SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENT}: Anatomical considerations led to the proposal that visual function is organized in separate processing streams: one (ventral) devoted to form and one (dorsal) devoted to motion. Several experimental results have challenged this view, arguing in favor of a more integrated view of visual processing. Here we add to this body of work, supporting a role for form information even in a function-extracting pattern motion direction from complex scenes-for which decisive evidence for the involvement of form signals has been lacking.},

Our model accounts for the detailed statistics of {LIP} spike trains and accurately predicts spike trains from task events on single trials. Moreover, we derived an optimal decoder for heterogeneous, multiplexed {LIP} responses that could be implemented in biologically plausible circuits. In contrast with interpretations of {LIP} as providing an instantaneous code for decision variables, we found that optimal decoding requires integrating {LIP} spikes over two distinct timescales. These analyses provide a detailed understanding of neural representations in {LIP} and a framework for studying the coding of multiplexed signals in higher brain areas.},

	abstract = {A large population of neurons can, in principle, produce an astronomical number of distinct firing patterns. In cortex, however, these patterns lie in a space of lower dimension, as if individual neurons were "obedient members of a huge orchestra". Here we use recordings from the visual cortex of mouse (Mus musculus) and monkey (Macaca mulatta) to investigate the relationship between individual neurons and the population, and to establish the underlying circuit mechanisms. We show that neighbouring neurons can differ in their coupling to the overall firing of the population, ranging from strongly coupled 'choristers' to weakly coupled 'soloists'. Population coupling is largely independent of sensory preferences, and it is a fixed cellular attribute, invariant to stimulus conditions. Neurons with high population coupling are more strongly affected by non-sensory behavioural variables such as motor intention. Population coupling reflects a causal relationship, predicting the response of a neuron to optogenetically driven increases in local activity. Moreover, population coupling indicates synaptic connectivity; the population coupling of a neuron, measured in vivo, predicted subsequent in vitro estimates of the number of synapses received from its neighbours. Finally, population coupling provides a compact summary of population activity; knowledge of the population couplings of n neurons predicts a substantial portion of their n(2) pairwise correlations. Population coupling therefore represents a novel, simple measure that characterizes the relationship of each neuron to a larger population, explaining seemingly complex network firing patterns in terms of basic circuit variables.},

The neural substrates conferring the ability to fluidly traverse complex routes are not well understood, but likely entail interactions between frontal, parietal, and rhinal cortices and the hippocampus. This paper demonstrates that posterior parietal cortical neurons map both individual and multiple navigational epochs with respect to their order in a route. In direct contrast to spatial firing patterns of hippocampal neurons, parietal neurons discharged in a place- and direction-independent fashion. Parietal route maps were scalable and versatile in that they were independent of the size and spatial configuration of navigational epochs. The results provide a framework in which to consider parietal function in spatial cognition.},

	abstract = {One of the primary functions of visual processing is to generate a spatial mapping of our immediate vicinity, in order to facilitate interaction. As yet it is unclear how this is achieved, but the process likely involves an accrual of information over time-a temporal integration of positional information (Eagleman \& Sejnowski, 2000; Krekelberg et al., 2000). Temporal integration is a common computational process evident in diverse settings, such as electrical engineering (Bryson \& Ho, 1975) and neural coding (Rao, Eagleman \& Sejnowski, 2001; Usher \& {McClelland}, 2001). In the later context it is sometimes assumed that integration dynamics are immobile, and consequently that they can be diagnostic of a sensory system (Arnold \& Lipp, 2011; Krauskopf \& Mollon, 1971; Snowden \& Braddick, 1991). Other data suggest that integration times can be flexible, varying in concert with the properties of a stimulus (Bair \& Movshon, 2004) or environment (Ossmy et al., 2013). Our data provide behavioral support for malleable integration times. We examine a motion-induced illusion of perceived position linked to temporal integration, and use prolonged exposure to motion of different speeds (sensory adaptation) to modulate the dynamics of neural activity. Results show that perceived position is governed by a weighted average of positional estimates from multiple channels with distinct, fixed integration times. Postadaptation channel contributions are reweighted, resulting in coding that is optimized to the dynamics of the prevailing environment.

In the other, the structure remains homogeneous and incapable of pattern retrieval. These findings are compatible with experimental results on early brain development, and provide an explanation for the existence of synaptic pruning.

	abstract = {Neural activity related to unrestrained movement through space was studied in rat sensorimotor and posterior parietal cortices during performance of an eight-arm, radial maze task. Nearly half of the cells exhibited movement-related activity that discriminated among three basic modes of locomotion: left turns, right turns, and forward motion. Correlates ranged from strong excitation (relative to the still condition) to strong inhibition, and were distributed among the movement modes in a variety of different ways. For example, cells that discriminated between clockwise and counterclockwise turns did so with either antagonistic responses or simple excitation or inhibition. Others showed either excitation or inhibition relative to both turning and the still condition, and hence were selective for forward motion. Many cells exhibited somatosensory responsiveness; however, in agreement with findings of others, motion correlates could rarely be sensibly explained by the somatosensory response. Moreover, movement correlates sometimes varied considerably with spatial context. Some cells exhibited more complex motion correlates, such as an apparent dependence on the nature of the preceding movement. Irrespective of the specific sensory or motor determinants of cell activity, which varied considerably among cells, the posterior neocortex of the rat appears to generate a robust and redundant internal representation of body motion through space. Such a representation could be useful in constructing "cognitive maps" of the environment.},

	abstract = {A complete understanding of sensory and motor processing requires characterization of how the nervous system processes time in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds (ms). Temporal processing on this scale is required for simple sensory problems, such as interval, duration, and motion discrimination, as well as complex forms of sensory processing, such as speech recognition. Timing is also required for a wide range of motor tasks from eyelid conditioning to playing the piano. Here we review the behavioral, electrophysiological, and theoretical literature on the neural basis of temporal processing. These data suggest that temporal processing is likely to be distributed among different structures, rather than relying on a centralized timing area, as has been suggested in internal clock models. We also discuss whether temporal processing relies on specialized neural mechanisms, which perform temporal computations independent of spatial ones. We suggest that, given the intricate link between temporal and spatial information in most sensory and motor tasks, timing and spatial processing are intrinsic properties of neural function, and specialized timing mechanisms such as delay lines, oscillators, or a spectrum of different time constants are not required. Rather temporal processing may rely on state-dependent changes in network dynamics.},

	doi = {10.1017/CBO9780511750540.027},
	abstract = {Some basic versions of the flash-lag effect have been known since the early decades of the twentieth century. Intriguingly, neural delays were as central in the early attempts at explaining the effect, as they are in the more recent investigations into its cause. For a changing visual stimulus a delayed registration of the stimulus by the central nervous system ({CNS}) constitutes an “error” between the instantaneously registered state of the stimulus on the one hand and its physical state on the other. Therefore, for animals to acquire food, mate, and avoid predators, compensation of sensory delays is essential. One may ask which component(s) of the {CNS} compensate for visual delays. Logically compensation could be carried out either by visual or motor mechanisms, or both. The motion extrapolation account of the flashlag effect challenged the dominant view that only motor mechanisms compensate for visual delays, suggesting instead that visual mechanisms also contribute. Controversy fueled by empirical observations with unpredictable motion, in particular the flash-initiated and flashterminated conditions of the flash-lag effect, soon followed; prima facie motion extrapolation could not accommodate these results. Armed with these challenging findings (primarily) several alternative accounts of flash-lag were proposed. In light of new developments, this chapter evaluates the motion extrapolation, motion sampling, motion integration, postdiction, differential latency, and attentional cuing accounts of flash-lag.},

Here we show that these mechanisms are matched to the statistics of the environment. First, we measured the joint distribution of luminance and contrast in patches selected from natural images and found that luminance and contrast were statistically independent of each other. This independence did not hold for artificial images with matched spectral characteristics. Second, we characterized the effects of the adaptive mechanisms in lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}), the direct recipient of retinal outputs. We found that luminance gain control had the same effect at all contrasts and that contrast gain control had the same effect at all mean luminances. Thus, the adaptive mechanisms for luminance and contrast operate independently, reflecting the very independence encountered in natural images.},

One of these, which cannot be explained by existing hypotheses, is that under certain conditions the mislocation magnitude tends to have zero or even negative values. A model is developed for explanation of the mislocation phenomenon. It is suggested that localization is based on: (1) information about the current eye position and (2) information about the stimulus locus on the retina. They both arrive at the localization centre with non-zero delays. The mode of information processing in this centre leads to a magnitude of mislocation which is proportional to the difference between the two delays and which could be positive, zero or negative. Factors which influence either delay should also influence the mislocation magnitude. ?? 1981.},

We examine whether independent temporal information can influence such errors. We asked participants to follow a randomly jumping dot with their eyes and to point at flashes that occurred near the time they made saccades. Such flashes are mislocalized. We presented a tone at different times relative to the flash. We found that the flash was mislocalized as if it had occurred closer in time to the tone. This demonstrates that temporal information is taken into consideration when combining sensory information streams for localization.},

	abstract = {It has been shown that people make systematic errors in the localization of a brief tactile stimulus that is delivered to the index finger while they are making an arm movement. Here we modeled these spatial errors with a probabilistic approach, assuming that they follow from temporal uncertainty about the occurrence of the stimulus. In the model, this temporal uncertainty converts into a spatial likelihood about the external stimulus location, depending on arm velocity. We tested the prediction of the model that the localization errors depend on arm velocity. Participants (n = 8) were instructed to localize a tactile stimulus that was presented to their index finger while they were making either slow- or fast-targeted arm movements. Our results confirm the model's prediction that participants make larger localization errors when making faster arm movements. The model, which was used to fit the errors for both slow and fast arm movements simultaneously, accounted very well for all the characteristics of these data with temporal uncertainty in stimulus processing as the only free parameter. We conclude that spatial errors in dynamic tactile perception stem from the temporal precision with which tactile inputs are processed.},

We wanted to know whether there are times at which obtaining information about the ball is particularly beneficial for catching it. We recently found that people could catch successfully if they saw any part of the ball's flight except the very end, when sensory-motor delays make it impossible to use new information. Nevertheless, there may be a preferred time to see the ball. We examined when six catchers would choose to look at the ball if they had to both catch the ball and find out what to do with it while the ball was approaching. A catcher and a thrower continuously threw a ball back and forth. We recorded their hand movements, the catcher's eye movements, and the ball's path. While the ball was approaching the catcher, information was provided on a screen about how the catcher should throw the ball back to the thrower (its peak height). This information disappeared just before the catcher caught the ball. Initially there was a slight tendency to look at the ball before looking at the screen but, later, most catchers tended to look at the screen before looking at the ball. Rather than being particularly eager to see the ball at a certain time, people appear to adjust their eye movements to the combined requirements of the task.},

In response to flashed stationary squares (0.4 deg) we obtained localized activity distributions in visual field coordinates, which we referred to as profiles across a 'population receptive field' ({PRF}). We here show how motion trajectories can be derived from activity across the {PRF} and how the representation of moving and flashed stimuli differs in position. We found that motion was represented by peaks of population activity that followed the stimulus with a speed-dependent lag. However, time-to-peak latencies were shorter by approximately 16 ms compared to the population responses to stationary flashes. In addition, motion representation showed a directional bias, as latencies were more reduced for peripheral-to-central motion compared to the opposite direction. We suggest that a moving stimulus provides 'preactivation' that allows more rapid processing than for a single flash event.},

Structural description is made possible through a solution to the dynamic binding problem: Temporary conjunctions of attributes (parts and relations) are represented by synchronized oscillatory activity among independent units representing those attributes. Specifically, the model uses synchrony (a) to parse images into their constituent parts, (b) to bind together the attributes of a part, and (c) to bind the relations to the parts to which they apply. Because it conjoins independent units temporarily, dynamic binding allows tremendous economy of representation and permits the representation to reflect the attribute structure of the shapes represented.},

	abstract = {Spike-frequency adaptation is known to enhance the transmission of information in sensory spiking neurons, by rescaling the dynamic range for input processing, matching it to the temporal statistics of the sensory stimulus. Achieving maximal information transmission has also been recently postulated as a role for Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity ({STDP}). However, the link between optimal plasticity and {STDP} in cortex remains loose, and so does the relationship between {STDP} and adaptation processes. We investigate how {STDP}, as described by recent minimal models derived from experimental data, influences the quality of information transmission in an adapting neuron. We show that a phenomenological model based on triplets of spikes yields almost the same information rate as an optimal model specially designed to this end. In contrast, the standard pair-based model of {STDP} does not improve information transmission as much. This result holds not only for additive {STDP} with hard weight bounds, known to produce bimodal distributions of synaptic weights, but also for weight-dependent {STDP} in the context of unimodal but skewed weight distributions. We analyze the similarities between the triplet model and the optimal learning rule, and find that the triplet effect is an important feature of the optimal model when the neuron is adaptive. If {STDP} is optimized for information transmission, it must take into account the dynamical properties of the postsynaptic cell, which might explain the target-cell specificity of {STDP}. In particular, it accounts for the differences found in vitro between {STDP} at excitatory synapses onto principal cells and those onto fast-spiking interneurons.},

	abstract = {Most models of sensory processing in the brain have a feedforward architecture in which each stage comprises simple linear filtering operations and nonlinearities. Models of this form have been used to explain a wide range of neurophysiological and psychophysical data, and many recent successes in artificial intelligence (with deep convolutional neural nets) are based on this architecture. However, neocortex is not a feedforward architecture. This paper proposes a first step toward an alternative computational framework in which neural activity in each brain area depends on a combination of feedforward drive (bottom-up from the previous processing stage), feedback drive (top-down context from the next stage), and prior drive (expectation). The relative contributions of feedforward drive, feedback drive, and prior drive are controlled by a handful of state parameters, which I hypothesize correspond to neuromodulators and oscillatory activity. In some states, neural responses are dominated by the feedforward drive and the theory is identical to a conventional feedforward model, thereby preserving all of the desirable features of those models. In other states, the theory is a generative model that constructs a sensory representation from an abstract representation, like memory recall. In still other states, the theory combines prior expectation with sensory input, explores different possible perceptual interpretations of ambiguous sensory inputs, and predicts forward in time. The theory, therefore, offers an empirically testable framework for understanding how the cortex accomplishes inference, exploration, and prediction.},

However, in the majority of real-life processes, past information is used continuously to process incoming information across multiple timescales. Considering single-unit, electrocorticography, and functional imaging data, we argue that (i) virtually all cortical circuits can accumulate information over time, and (ii) the timescales of accumulation vary hierarchically, from early sensory areas with short processing timescales (10s to 100s of milliseconds) to higher-order areas with long processing timescales (many seconds to minutes). In this hierarchical systems perspective, memory is not restricted to a few localized stores, but is intrinsic to information processing that unfolds throughout the brain on multiple timescales.},

Robust place-cell activity was present during movement along a virtual linear track. From whole-cell recordings, we identified three subthreshold signatures of place fields: an asymmetric ramp-like depolarization of the baseline membrane potential, an increase in the amplitude of intracellular theta oscillations, and a phase precession of the intracellular theta oscillation relative to the extracellularly recorded theta rhythm. These intracellular dynamics underlie the primary features of place-cell rate and temporal codes.

Individual neurons had transient activation staggered relative to one another in time, forming a sequence of neuronal activation spanning the entire length of a task trial. Distinct sequences of neurons were triggered on trials with opposite behavioural choices and defined divergent, choice-specific trajectories through a state space of neuronal population activity. Cells participating in the different sequences and at distinct time points in the task were anatomically intermixed over microcircuit length scales ({\textless}100 micrometres).

	abstract = {Gradual accumulation of evidence is thought to be fundamental for decision-making, and its neural correlates have been found in several brain regions. Here we develop a generalizable method to measure tuning curves that specify the relationship between neural responses and mentally accumulated evidence, and apply it to distinguish the encoding of decision variables in posterior parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex (frontal orienting fields, {FOF}). We recorded the firing rates of neurons in posterior parietal cortex and {FOF} from rats performing a perceptual decision-making task. Classical analyses uncovered correlates of accumulating evidence, similar to previous observations in primates and also similar across the two regions. However, tuning curve assays revealed that while the posterior parietal cortex encodes a graded value of the accumulating evidence, the {FOF} has a more categorical encoding that indicates, throughout the trial, the decision provisionally favoured by the evidence accumulated so far. Contrary to current views, this suggests that premotor activity in the frontal cortex does not have a role in the accumulation process, but instead has a more categorical function, such as transforming accumulated evidence into a discrete choice. To probe causally the role of {FOF} activity, we optogenetically silenced it during different time points of the trial. Consistent with a role in committing to a categorical choice at the end of the evidence accumulation process, but not consistent with a role during the accumulation itself, a behavioural effect was observed only when {FOF} silencing occurred at the end of the perceptual stimulus. Our results place important constraints on the circuit logic of brain regions involved in decision-making.},

	abstract = {During active somatosensation, neural signals expected from movement of the sensors are suppressed in the cortex, whereas information related to touch is enhanced. This tactile sup-pression underlies low-noise encoding of relevant tactile features and the brain's ability to make fine tactile discriminations. Layer (L) 4 excitatory neurons in the barrel cortex, the major target of the somatosensory thalamus ({VPM}), respond to touch, but have low spike rates and low sensitivity to the movement of whiskers. Most neurons in {VPM} respond to touch and also show an increase in spike rate with whisker movement. Therefore, signals related to self-movement are suppressed in L4. Fast-spiking ({FS}) interneurons in L4 show similar dynamics to {VPM} neurons. Stimulation of halorhodopsin in {FS} interneurons causes a reduction in {FS} neuron activity and an increase in L4 excitatory neuron activity. This decrease of activity of L4 {FS} neurons contradicts the "paradoxical effect" predicted in net-works stabilized by inhibition and in strongly-coupled networks. To explain these observa-tions, we constructed a model of the L4 circuit, with connectivity constrained by in vitro measurements. The model explores the various synaptic conductance strengths for which L4 {FS} neurons actively suppress baseline and movement-related activity in layer 4 excit-atory neurons. Feedforward inhibition, in concert with recurrent intracortical circuitry, pro-duces tactile suppression. Synaptic delays in feedforward inhibition allow transmission of temporally brief volleys of activity associated with touch. Our model provides a mechanistic explanation of a behavior-related computation implemented by the thalamocortical circuit.},

	abstract = {Two-photon imaging of bulk-loaded calcium dyes can record action potentials ({APs}) simultaneously from dozens of spatially resolved neurons in vivo. Extending this technique to awake animals, however, has remained technically challenging due to artifacts caused by brain motion. Since in two-photon excitation microscopes image pixels are captured sequentially by scanning a focused pulsed laser across small areas of interest within the brain, fast displacements of the imaged area can distort the image nonuniformly. If left uncorrected, brain motion in awake animals will cause artifactual fluorescence changes, masking the small functional fluorescence increases associated with {AP} discharge. We therefore present a procedure for detection and correction of both fast and slow displacements in two-photon imaging of awake animals. Our algorithm, based on the Lucas-Kanade framework, operates directly on the motion-distorted imaging data, requiring neither external signals such as heartbeat nor a distortion-free template image. Motion correction accuracy was tested in silico over a wide range of simplified and realistic displacement trajectories and for multiple levels of fluorescence noise. Accuracy was confirmed in vivo by comparing solutions obtained from red and green fluorophores imaged simultaneously. Finally, the accuracy of {AP} detection from motion-displaced bulk-loaded calcium imaging is evaluated with and without motion correction, and we conclude that accurate motion correction as achieved by this procedure is both necessary and sufficient for single {AP} detection in awake animals.},

	abstract = {Interacting with the natural environment leads to complex stimulations of our senses. Here we focus on the estimation of visual speed, a critical source of information for the survival of many animal species as they monitor moving prey or approaching dangers. In mammals, and in particular in primates, speed information is conceived to be represented by a set of channels sensitive to different spatial and temporal characteristics of the optic flow [1–5]. However, it is still largely unknown how the brain accurately infers the speed of complex natural scenes from this set of spatiotemporal channels [6–14]. As complex stimuli, we chose a set of well-controlled moving naturalistic textures called “compound motion clouds” ({CMCs}) [15, 16] that simultaneously activate multiple spatiotemporal channels. We found that {CMC} stimuli that have the same physical speed are perceived moving at different speeds depending on which channel combinations are activated. We developed a computational model demonstrating that the activity in a given channel is both boosted and weakened after a systematic pattern over neighboring channels. This pattern of interactions can be understood as a combination of two components oriented in speed (consistent with a slow-speed prior) and scale (sharpening of similar features). Interestingly, the interaction along scale implements a lateral inhibition mechanism, a canonical principle that hitherto was found to operate mainly in early sensory processing. Overall, the speed-scale normalization mechanism may reflect the natural tendency of the visual system to integrate complex inputs into one coherent percept.},

Using closed-loop experiments, we explore selectively the space of possible perturbations around a given stimulus. We then show that the response of the retinal population to these small perturbations can be described by a local linear model. Using this model, we computed the sensitivity of the neural response to arbitrary temporal perturbations of the stimulus, and found a peak in the sensitivity as a function of the frequency of the perturbations. Based on a minimal theory of sensory processing, we argue that this peak is set to maximize information transmission. Our approach is relevant to testing the efficient coding hypothesis locally in any context where no reliable encoding model is known.},

A central question is how the motor system adapts in response to this error: are the motor commands changed to bring the eyes to a different goal, akin to a remapping of the target, or is adaptation focused on the processes that monitor the ongoing motor commands and correct them midflight, akin to changes that act via internal feedback? Here, we found that, in the gain-down paradigm, the brain learned to produce a smaller amplitude saccade by altering the trajectory of the saccade. The adapted saccades had reduced peak velocities, reduced accelerations, shallower decelerations, and increased durations compared with a control saccade of equal amplitude. These changes were consistent with a change in an internal feedback that acted as a forward model. However, in the gain-up paradigm, the brain learned to produce a larger amplitude saccade with trajectories that were identical with those of control saccades of equal amplitude. Therefore, whereas the gain-down paradigm appeared to induce adaptation via an internal feedback that controlled saccades midflight, the gain-up paradigm induced adaptation primarily via target remapping. Our simulations explained that, for each condition, the specific adaptation produced a saccade that brought the eyes to the target with the smallest motor costs.},

Using this stimulus, we quantified the ability of cortical cells to encode independently and simultaneously the stimulus envelope and fine structure. Specifically, by reverse-correlating unit responses with these two stimulus dimensions, we measured the spectrotemporal response fields ({STRFs}) associated with the processing of the envelope, the fine structure, and the complete stimulus. A1 cells respond well to the slow spectrotemporal envelopes and produce a wide variety of {STRFs}. In over 70\% of cases, A1 units also track the fine-structure modulations precisely, throughout the stimulus, and for frequencies up to several hundred Hertz. Such a dual response, however, is contingent on the cell being driven by both fast and slow modulations, in that the response to the slowly modulated envelope gates the expression of the fine structure. We also demonstrate that either a simplified model of synaptic depression and facilitation, and/or a cortical network of thalamic excitation and cortical inhibition can account for major trends in the observed findings. Finally, we discuss the potential functional significance and perceptual relevance of these coexistent, complementary dynamic response modes.},

Many cortical areas are organized into functional columns, in which neurons are believed to be densely connected and to share common input. Numerous studies report a high degree of correlated variability between nearby cells. We developed chronically implanted multitetrode arrays offering unprecedented recording quality to reexamine this question in the primary visual cortex of awake macaques. We found that even nearby neurons with similar orientation tuning show virtually no correlated variability. Our findings suggest a refinement of current models of cortical microcircuit architecture and function: Either adjacent neurons share only a few percent of their inputs or, alternatively, their activity is actively decorrelated.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004866},
	abstract = {This study investigates the inter-trial variability of saccade trajectories observed in five rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). For each time point during a saccade, the inter-trial variance of eye position and its covariance with eye end position were evaluated. Data were modeled by a superposition of three noise components due to 1) planning noise, 2) signal-dependent motor noise, and 3) signal-dependent premotor noise entering within an internal feedback loop. Both planning noise and signal-dependent motor noise (together called accumulating noise) predict a simple S-shaped variance increase during saccades, which was not sufficient to explain the data. Adding noise within an internal feedback loop enabled the model to mimic variance/covariance structure in each monkey, and to estimate the noise amplitudes and the feedback gain. Feedback noise had little effect on end point noise, which was dominated by accumulating noise. This analysis was further extended to saccades executed during inactivation of the caudal fastigial nucleus ({cFN}) on one side of the cerebellum. Saccades ipsiversive to an inactivated {cFN} showed more end point variance than did normal saccades. During {cFN} inactivation, eye position during saccades was statistically more strongly coupled to eye position at saccade end. The proposed model could fit the variance/covariance structure of ipsiversive and contraversive saccades. Inactivation effects on saccade noise are explained by a decrease of the feedback gain and an increase of planning and/or signal-dependent motor noise. The decrease of the fitted feedback gain is consistent with previous studies suggesting a role for the cerebellum in an internal feedback mechanism. Increased end point variance did not result from impaired feedback but from the increase of accumulating noise. The effects of {cFN} inactivation on saccade noise indicate that the effects of {cFN} inactivation cannot be explained entirely with the {cFN}'s direct connections to the saccade-related premotor centers in the brainstem.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02779},
	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (deep {RL}) has been successful in learning sophisticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, benefiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a "fast" reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network ({RNN}) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$, the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the {RNN}, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose ("slow") {RL} algorithm. The {RNN} receives all information a typical {RL} algorithm would receive, including observations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process ({MDP}). The activations of the {RNN} store the state of the "fast" {RL} algorithm on the current (previously unseen) {MDP}. We evaluate {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite {MDPs}. After {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ is trained, its performance on new {MDPs} is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test {RL}\${\textasciicircum}2\$ on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.},

In reaching tasks with multiple targets, dorsal premotor cortex ({PMd}) appears to represent all possible actions simultaneously. However, in many situations we are not presented with explicit choices. Instead, we must estimate the best action based on noisy information and execute it while still uncertain of our choice. Here we asked how both primary motor cortex (M1) and {PMd} represented reach direction during a task in which a monkey made reaches based on noisy, uncertain target information. We found that with increased uncertainty, neurons in {PMd} actually enhanced their representation of unlikely movements throughout both planning and execution. The magnitude of this effect was highly variable across sessions, and was correlated with a measure of the monkeys' behavioral uncertainty. These effects were not present in M1. Our findings suggest that {PMd} represents and maintains a full distribution of potentially correct actions.},

Recent research has shown that localized sensory adaptation compresses perceived duration of brief visual events in the adapted location; however, there is disagreement on whether the source of these temporal distortions is cortical or pre-cortical. The current study reveals that spatially localized duration compression can also be direction contingent, in that duration compression is induced when adapting and test stimuli move in the same direction but not when they move in opposite directions. Because of its direction-contingent nature, the induced duration compression reported here is likely to be cortical in origin. A second experiment shows that the adaptation processes driving duration compression can occur at or beyond human cortical area {MT}+, a specialized motion center located upstream from primary visual cortex. The direction-specificity of these temporal mechanisms, in conjunction with earlier reports of pre-cortical temporal mechanisms driving duration perception, suggests that our encoding of subsecond event duration is driven by activity at multiple levels of processing. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In unanesthetized guinea pigs, thalamic ({CGM}), and cortical (auditory I) neurons were recorded simultaneously. Nine of 69 neuron pairs showed a positive cross-correlation of their spontaneous activities, with increased discharge probability of the cortical neuron beginning 2–5 ms after the discharge of the {CGM}-neuron. The individual neurons of such pairs had an identical {CF} and the same spectral responsiveness. The responses of cortical neurons to pure tones were much more phasic than those of the corresponding {CGM}-neurons. Thalamic neurons could be driven up to much higher {AM}- and {FM}-modulation frequencies (100 Hz) than cortical neurons, which usually ceased to follow {AM}-frequencies above 20 Hz. Stronger or weaker suppression of tonic response components in cortical and thalamic neurons and the lower {AM}-range of cortical neurons is related to stronger or weaker intracortical and intrathalamic inhibition respectively. Response characteristics to {FM}-stimuli are similar to those of {AM}-stimuli. All {CGM} and cortical neurons responded to a variety of natural calls of the same or of other species. Responses of {CGM}-cells represented more components of a call than cortical cells even if the two cells were synaptically connected. In cortical cells, repetitive elements of a call were not represented if the repetition rate was too high. High modulation frequencies within a call, such as those of the fundamental frequency, could still be separated in the response of some {CGM}-neurons, but never in those of cortical neurons. Both {CGM} and cortical cells responded essentially to transients (amplitude or frequency modulations) within a call, if spectral components of such elements were within the spectral sensitivity of the cell. Spectral components outside the spectral sensitivity range could result in suppression of spontaneous discharge rate. Responses of cortical and {CGM}-cells, and thus the representation of call elements by neuronal responses, varied with the intensity of a call. It is suggested that, at higher levels of the auditory system, essential information about the temporal features of complex sounds may be represented by neural responses to transients in various spectral regions.},

We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80\% of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons.},

	abstract = {The primate visual system has an exquisite ability to discriminate partially occluded shapes. Recent electrophysiological recordings suggest that response dynamics in intermediate visual cortical area V4, shaped by feedback from prefrontal cortex ({PFC}), may play a key role. To probe the algorithms that may underlie these findings, we build and test a model of V4 and {PFC} interactions based on a hierarchical predictive coding framework. We propose that probabilistic inference occurs in two steps. Initially, V4 responses are driven solely by bottom-up sensory input and are thus strongly influenced by the level of occlusion. After a delay, V4 responses combine both feedforward input and feedback signals from the {PFC}; the latter reflect predictions made by {PFC} about the visual stimulus underlying V4 activity. We find that this model captures key features of V4 and {PFC} dynamics observed in experiments. Specifically, {PFC} responses are strongest for occluded stimuli and delayed responses in V4 are less sensitive to occlusion, supporting our hypothesis that the feedback signals from {PFC} underlie robust discrimination of occluded shapes. Thus, our study proposes that area V4 and {PFC} participate in hierarchical inference, with feedback signals encoding top-down predictions about occluded shapes.},

The responses to both stimulus ensembles were well described as rate-modulated Poisson processes but with very high precision (approximately 3 ms) modulation functions underlying the time-varying responses. Information-theoretic analysis revealed that the responses encoded only approximately 1 bit/s about constant-velocity stimuli but up to 29 bits/s about the time-varying stimuli.

First, {fMRI} responses in human primary visual cortex (V1) depend separably on stimulus timing and stimulus contrast. Second, responses to long-duration stimuli can be predicted from responses to shorter duration stimuli. Third, the noise in the {fMRI} data is independent of stimulus contrast and temporal period. Although these tests can not prove the correctness of the linear transform model, they might have been used to reject the model. Because the linear transform model is consistent with our data, we proceeded to estimate the temporal {fMRI} impulse-response function and the underlying (presumably neural) contrast-response function of human V1.},

The fundamental assumption of the proposed theory, recognition-by-components ({RBC}), is that a modest set of generalized-cone components, called geons, can be derived from contrasts of five readily detectable properties of edges in a two-dimensional image. The detection of these properties is generally invariant over viewing position and image quality and consequently allows robust object perception when the image is projected from a novel viewpoint or is degraded. {RBC} thus provides a principled account of the heretofore undecided relation between the classic principles of perceptual organization and pattern recognition. The results from experiments on the perception of briefly presented pictures by human observers provide empirical support for the theory. ((c) 1999 {APA}/{PsycINFO}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Distributed neural processing likely entails the capability of networks to reconfigure dynamically the directionality and strength of their functional connections. Yet, the neural mechanisms that may allow such dynamic routing of the information flow are not yet fully understood. We investigated the role of gamma band (50-80 Hz) oscillations in transient modulations of communication among neural populations by using measures of direction-specific causal information transfer. We found that the local phase of gamma-band rhythmic activity exerted a stimulus-modulated and spatially-asymmetric directed effect on the firing rate of spatially separated populations within the primary visual cortex. The relationships between gamma phases at different sites (phase shifts) could be described as a stimulus-modulated gamma-band wave propagating along the spatial directions with the largest information transfer. We observed transient stimulus-related changes in the spatial configuration of phases (compatible with changes in direction of gamma wave propagation) accompanied by a relative increase of the amount of information flowing along the instantaneous direction of the gamma wave. These effects were specific to the gamma-band and suggest that the time-varying relationships between gamma phases at different locations mark, and possibly causally mediate, the dynamic reconfiguration of functional connections.},

Discrete dynamics that emerge in brain networks are believed to be the neuronal correlate of category formation. Observations of such dynamics have recently been made; however, it is still unresolved if they actually match perceptual categories. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of mice, we show that local network activity evoked by sounds is constrained to few response modes. Transitions between response modes are characterized by an abrupt switch, indicating attractor-like, discrete dynamics. Moreover, we show that local cortical responses quantitatively predict discrimination performance and spontaneous categorization of sounds in behaving mice. Our results therefore demonstrate that local nonlinear dynamics in the auditory cortex generate spontaneous sound categories which can be selected for behavioral or perceptual decisions.},

Observers were presented with a moving stimulus and a static reference stimulus in separate intervals, and judged which interval they perceived as having a longer duration, under conditions with eye fixation (Experiment 1) and with eye movement at same velocity as the moving stimulus (Experiment 2). The data indicated that the perceived duration was longer under object motion, and depended on the actual movement of the object rather than relative retinal motion.

Here, we used {fMRI} to map the retinotopic organization of medial ventral temporal cortex in 4 monkeys (2 male and 2 female). We confirm the presence of visual field maps within and around the lower bank of the {STS} and extend these prior findings to scene-selective cortex in the ventral-most regions of {IT}. Within the occipito-temporal sulcus ({OTS}), we identified two retinotopic areas, {OTS}1 and {OTS}2. The polar angle representation of {OTS}2 was a mirror reversal of the {OTS}1 representation. These regions contained representations of the contralateral periphery and were selectively active for scene vs. face, body, or object images. The extent of this retinotopy parallels that in humans and shows that the organization of the scene network is preserved across primate species. In addition retinotopic maps were identified in dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, and frontal cortex as well as the thalamus, including both the {LGN} and pulvinar. Taken together, it appears that most, if not all, of the macaque visual system contains organized representations of visual space.{SIGNIFICANCE} {STATEMENTPrimates} have specialized domains in inferior temporal ({IT}) cortex that are responsive to particular image categories. Though retinotopic maps are considered a fundamental organizing principle of posterior visual cortex, {IT} traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy. Recent imaging studies have demonstrated the presence of several visual field maps within lateral {IT}. Using neuroimaging, we found multiple representations of visual space within ventral {IT} cortex of macaques that included scene-selective cortex. Scene domains were biased towards the peripheral visual field. These data demonstrate the prevalence of visual field maps throughout the primate visual system, including late stages in the ventral visual hierarchy, and support the idea that domains representing different categories are biased towards different parts of the visual field.},

	abstract = {Integrating information is essential to measure the physical 2D motion of a surface from both ambiguous local 1D motion of its elongated edges and non-ambiguous 2D motion of its features such as corners or texture elements. The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course as read from tracking eye movements: first, local 1D motion signals are extracted and pooled to initiate ocular responses, then 2D motion signals are integrated to adjust the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these 1D and 2D motion computations are still unclear. One hypothesis is that their different dynamics may be explained from different contrast sensitivities. To test this, we measured contrast-response functions of early, 1D-driven and late, 2D-driven components of ocular following responses to different motion stimuli: gratings, plaids and barberpoles. We found that contrast dynamics of 1D-driven responses are nearly identical across the different stimuli. On the contrary, late 2D-driven components with either plaids or barberpoles have similar latencies but different contrast dynamics. Temporal dynamics of both 1D- and 2D-driven responses demonstrates that the different contrast gains are set very early during the response time course. Running a Bayesian model of motion integration, we show that a large family of contrast-response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of 1D and 2D motion signals for each stimulus and by the shape of the prior distribution. However, the pure delay (i.e. largely independent upon contrast) observed between 1D- and 2D-motion supports the fact that 1D and 2D probability distributions are computed independently. This two-pathway Bayesian model supports the idea that 1D and 2D mechanisms represent edges and features motion in parallel.},

	abstract = {Our goal is to understand the dynamics of neural computations in low-level vision. We study how the substrate of this system, that is local biochemical neural processes, could combine to give rise to an efficient and global perception. We will study these neural computations at different scales from the single-cell to the whole visual system to infer generic aspects of the underlying neural code which may help to understand this cognitive ability. In fact, the architecture of cortical areas, such as the Primary Visual Cortex ({VI}), is massively parallel and we will focus on cortical columns as generic adaptive micro-circuits. To stress on the dynamical aspect of the processing, we will also focus on the transient response, that is during the first milliseconds after the presentation of a stimulus. In a generic model of a visual area, we propose to study the neural code as implementing visual pattern matching, that is as efficiently inverting a known model of image synthesis. A possible solution offered by the architecture of the visual pathways could be to represent at first on the surface of the cortical area how well the prototypical visual features are matched by a combination of inferential mechanisms as ideal observers. We studied the efficiency of this representation by rating the statistics of the output using natural scenes, that is scenes occurring frequently. We show that this may be finally used to provide a behavioral output such as an eye movement. However, constraints specific to the visual system imply that the set of prototypical features is not independent and that the cortical columns should communicate to produce an efficient, sparse solution. We will present efficient algorithms and representations based on the event-based nature of neural computations. By explicitely defining this efficiency, we propose then a simple implementation of Sparse Spike Coding using greedy inference mechanisms but also how the system may adapt in a unsupervised fashion. These computations may be implemented in simple models of neural networks by explicitly setting the lateral connectivity between populations of columns. Using natural scenes, this algorithm provides a model of V1 which exhibit prototypical properties of neural activities in that area. We show simple applications in the field of image processing as a quantitative method to evaluate these different cortical models.},

	abstract = {Most studies of cortical network dynamics are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood couplings 1, focussing on a rather local scale. Neuronal connections in the cortex, however, show a more complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range patchy connections 2,3 as shown in the figure: It represents a tracer injection (gray areas) in the {GM} of a flattened cortex (top view): Black dots indicate neuron positions, blue lines their patchy axonal ramifications, and red lines represent the local connections. Moreover, to include distant synapses, one has to enlarge the spatial scale from the typically assumed 1mm to 5mm side length. As it is our aim to analyze more realistic network models of the cortex we assume a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometry of dendritesand axons 3. Here, we ask to what extent the assumption of specific geometric traits influences the resulting dynamical behavior of these networks. Analyzing various characteristic measures that describe spiking neurons (e.g., coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient), we compare the dynamical state spaces of different connectivity types: purely random or purely local couplings, a combination of local and distant synapses, and connectivity structures with patchy projections. On top of biologically realistic background states, a stimulus is applied in order to analyze their stabilities. As previous studies 1, we also find different dynamical states depending on the external input rate and the numerical relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic weights. Preliminary results indicate, however, that transitions between these states are much sharper in case of local or patchy couplings. This work is supported by {EU} Grant 15879 ({FACETS}).

	rights = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Computations in a cortical column are characterized by the dynamical, event-based nature of neuronal signals and are structured by the layered and parallel structure of cortical areas. But they are also characterized by their efficiency in terms of rapidity and robustness. We propose and study here a model of information integration in the primary visual cortex (V1) thanks to the parallel and interconnected network of similar cortical columns. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of contrast gain control mechanisms as a function of the distribution of information relevance in a small population of cortical columns. This cortical area is modeled as a collection of similar cortical columns which receive input and are linked according to a specific connectivity pattern which is relevant to this area. These columns are simulated using the {\textbackslash}sc Nest simulator Morrison04 using conductance-based Integrate-and-Fire neurons and consist vertically in 3 different layers. The architecture was inspired by neuro-physiological observations on the influence of neighboring activities on pyramidal cells activity and correlates with the lateral flow of information observed in the primary visual cortex, notably in optical imaging experiments Jancke04, and is similar in its final implementation to local micro-circuitry of the cortical column presented by Grossberg05. \% They show prototypical spontaneous dynamical behavior to different levels of noise which are relevant to the generic modeling of biological cortical columns Kremkow05. In the future, the connectivity will be derived from an algorithm that was used for modeling the transient spiking response of a layer of neurons to a flashed image and which was based on the Matching Pursuit algorithm Perrinet04. \% The visual input is first transmitted from the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus ({LGN}) using the model of Gazeres98. It transforms the image flow into a stream of spikes with contrast gain control mechanisms specific to the retina and the {LGN}. This spiking activity converges to the pyramidal cells of layer 2/3 thanks to the specification of receptive fields in layer 4 providing a preference for oriented local contrasts in the spatio-temporal visual flow. In particular, we use in these experiments visual input organized in a center-surround spatial pattern which was optimized in size to maximize the response of a column in the center and to the modulation of this response by the surround (bipartite stimulus). This class of stimuli provide different levels of input activation and of visual ambiguity in the visual space which were present in the spatio-temporal correlations in the input spike flow optimized to the resolution of cortical columns in the visual space. It thus provides a method to reveal the dynamics of information integration and particularly of contrast gain control which are characteristic to the function of V1.},

In both human and monkey ocular{\textbackslash}nfol- lowing studies, it has been shown that modulations of the contrast{\textbackslash}nresponse functions ({CRF}) induced by a peripheral stimulus are delayed.{\textbackslash}{nWe} inves- tigated the role of cortico-cortical interactions on this{\textbackslash}ndelayed contextual modulations using recording of population activity{\textbackslash}nwith voltage sensitive dye imaging ({VSDI}) in area V1 of behaving{\textbackslash}nmonkeys. Dynamics of contrast response functions to a local stimulus{\textbackslash}nwere found to be very similar in V1 cortical activity and ocular{\textbackslash}nfollowing responses ({OFR}). At both levels, contrast gains increase{\textbackslash}nover time in response to a single grating motion. However, adding{\textbackslash}na dynamical surround both clamps the contrast gains to their initial{\textbackslash}nvalue and maintains larger dynamical ranges. Using an ideal observer{\textbackslash}nmodel, we show that these results can match the behavioral observation{\textbackslash}n(see Perrinet et al. {VSS} 2009). To investigate the cortical origin{\textbackslash}nof this modulation, the visual input was manipulated while measuring{\textbackslash}{nV}1 activity using {VSDI}.

	volume = {11},
	rights = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Neurons receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs whose temporal interplay determines their spiking behavior. On average, excitation (Gexc) and inhibition (Ginh) balance each other, such that spikes are elicited by fluctuations 1. In addition, it has been shown in vivo that Gexc and Ginh are correlated, with Ginh lagging Gexc only by few milliseconds (6ms), creating a small temporal integration window 2,3. This correlation structure could be induced by feed-forward inhibition ({FFI}), which has been shown to be present at many sites in the central nervous system. To characterize the functional consequences of the {FFI}, we first modeled a simple circuit using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses and studied the effect on the single neuron integration. We then coupled many of such circuits to construct a feed-forward network (synfire chain 4,5) and investigated the effect of {FFI} on signal propagation along such feed-forward network. We found that the small temporal integration window, induced by the {FFI}, changes the integrative properties of the neuron. Only transient stimuli could produce a response when the {FFI} was active whereas without {FFI} the neuron responded to both steady and transient stimuli. Due to the increase in selectivity to transient inputs, the conditions of signal propagation through the feed-forward network changed as well. Whereas synchronous inputs could reliable propagate, high asynchronous input rates, which are known to induce synfire activity 6, failed to do so. In summary, the {FFI} increased the stability of the synfire chain.

Neuronal connections in the cortex, however, show a complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range connections, the latter featuring a so-called patchy projection pattern, i.e., spatially clustered synapses [3,4]. The idea of our project is to provide and to analyze probabilistic network models that more adequately represent horizontal connectivity in the cortex. To include long-range connections, we have to enlarge the spatial scale from the usually considered 1mm to 5mm side length. This enables us to assume a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometry of dendrites and axons. Our aim is to examine to what extent the assumption of specific geometric traits influences the resulting dynamical behavior of these networks. In particular, we ask whether such more realistic networks exhibit different dynamical states [1] (e.g., regular vs. irregular and synchronous vs. asynchronous firing) compared to randomly connected ones.},

	abstract = {In order to analyze the characteristics of a rich dynamic visual environment, the visual system must integrate information collected at different scales through different spatiotemporal frequency channels. Still, it remains unclear how reliable representations of motion direction or speed are elaborated when presented with large bandwidth motion stimuli or natural statistics. Last year, we have shown that broadening the spatiotemporal frequency content of a textured pattern moving at constant speed leads to different results on a reflexive tracking task and a speed discrimination task. Larger bandwidth stimuli increase response amplitude and sensitivity of ocular following, consistently with a maximum-likelihood ({ML}) model of motion decoding. In contrast, larger bandwidth stimuli impair speed discrimination performance, suggesting that the perceptual system cannot take advantage of such additional, redundant information. Instead of {ML}, a gain control decoding mechanism can explain the drop in performance, suggesting that action and perception rely on different decoding mechanisms. To further investigate such task-dependant pooling of motion information, we measured pattern discrimination performance using these textured stimuli. Two noise patterns were presented sequentially for 250 ms on a {CRT} monitor (1280 × 1024 @ 100 Hz) and covered 47° of visual angle with identical properties (mean {SF}, bandwidth {SF}, speed) except for a randomized phase spectrum. A test pattern was then presented and subjects were asked to match it with one or the other reference stimulus ({ABX} task). At small bandwidth and optimal mean spatial frequency (0.3 cpd), subjects were able to discriminate the two patterns with high accuracy. Performance dropped to chance level as spatial frequency bandwidth increased. Increasing the mean spatial frequency decreased the overall performance. Again, these results suggest that perceptual performance is deteriorated in presence of larger information.},

	abstract = {Under natural viewing conditions, large eye movements are interspace by small eye movements (microsaccade). Recent works have shown that these two kinds of eye movements are generate by the same oculomotor mechanisms (Goffart et al., 2012) and are driven from the same visual information (Simoncini et al., {VSS} 2012 abstract). These results seem to demonstrate that microsaccade and saccade represent a continuum of the same ocular movement. However, if the role played in vision perception by large saccades is clearly identified, the role of the microsaccade is not clearly defined. In order to investigate the role of microsaccade, we measured pattern discrimination performance using an {ABX} match-to-sample task during the presentation of 1/f natural statistics texture where we varied the spatial frequency contents. We compared perceptual performance with eye movements recorded during the task. We found that the rate of microsaccadic movements changed as a function of the subjects task strategy. In particular, in the trials where the perception of the difference between the stimuli was simple (low spatial frequency) the subjects used the information provided by all the stimuli to do the task and the microsaccadic rate for all the stimuli ({ABX}) was the same. However, when the perception of the difference between the stimuli was harder (for instance for high spatial frequency), the subjects rather used the information provided by the last two stimuli only and the microsaccadic rate for the image {BX} increased respect at the image A. These results demonstrate that microsaccadic eye movements also play a role during the analysis of the visual scene and that such experiments can help decipher their participation to perception of the scene.

	abstract = {Estimating object speed in visual scenes is a critical part of perception. While various aspects of speed computation including discrimination thresholds, neural mechanisms and spatial integration mechanisms have been studied, there remain areas to elucidate. One is the integration of information across spatio-temporal frequency channels to compute speed. We probe this integration with a 2-{AFC} psychophysical task in which moving random phase noise stimuli are used with experimenter defined frequency parameters and bandwidths to target specific neural populations. They are presented for 300ms in a large square aperture with smooth eye movements recorded while speed discrimination judgements are made over two intervals. There is no instruction to observers to pursue the stimuli and no pre trial saccade to induce a classic ocular following response. After a latency, eye movements follow the stimulated direction presumably to facilitate the speed judgement. Within each of the two intervals, we randomly vary a range of spatial frequency and speed parameters respectively such that stimuli at the centre of the ranges are identical. The aim is to characterise the speed response of the eye movements recorded in a context which creates an ocular motor â€˜actionâ€™ during a perceptual task instead of artificially separating the two. Within the speed varied intervals, averaged eye movements are systematically modulated in strength by stimulus speed. Within the spatial frequency intervals, higher frequencies perceived as faster in discrimination responses interestingly show no corresponding strengthening of eye responses particularly at higher contrasts where they may be weaker. Thus for a pair of stimuli matched for contrast and perceived speed, this early eye response appears to be driven by a contrast dependent low level motion energy like computation. We characterise an underlying spatial frequency response which is shifted towards lower frequencies, unlike the perceptual responses and is probably separate from perception.},

	abstract = {Analysis and interpretation of a visual scene to extract its cate- gory, such as whether it contains an animal, is typically assumed to involve higher-level associative brain areas. Previous propos- als have been based on a series of processing steps organized in amulti-level hierarchy thatwould progressively analyze the scene at increasing levels of abstraction, fromcontour extraction to low- level object recognition and finally to object categorization (Serre, {PNAS} 2007). We explore here an alternative hypothesis that the statistics of edge co-occurences are sufficient to perform a rough yet robust (translation, scale, and rotation invariant) scene cate- gorization. The method is based on a realistic model of image analysis in the primary visual cortex that extends previous work from Geisler et al. (Vis. Res. 2001). Using a scale-space analysis coupled with a sparse coding algorithm, we achieved detailed and robust extraction of edges in different sets of natural images. This edge-based representation allows for a simple characterization of the “association field” of edges by computing the statistics of co- occurrences. We showthat the geometry of angles made between edges is sufficient to distinguish between different sets of natural images taken in a variety of environments (natural, man-made, or containing an animal). Specifically, a simple classifier, working solely on the basis of this geometry, gives performance similar to that of hierarchical models and of humans in rapid-categorization tasks. Such results call attention to the importance of the relative geometry of local image patches in visual computation, with im- plications for designing efficient image analysis systems. Most importantly, they challenge assumptions about the flow of com- putations in the visual system and emphasize the relative impor- tance in this process of associative connections, and in particular of intra-areal lateral connections.},

	abstract = {Humans are able to interact successfully with moving objects in our dynamic world and the visual system effi ciently performs the motion computation that makes this possible. Object speed and direction are estimated following the integration of information across cortical motion sensitive channels. Speed estimation along this system is not fully understood, particularly the mapping function between the actual speed of viewed objects and that perceived by observers, a question we address in this work. It has been demonstrated that perceived speed is profoundly influenced by object contrast, spatial frequency, stimulus complexity and frequency bandwidth. In a 2 interval forced choice speed discrimination task, we present a random phase textured motion stimulus to probe small shifts in perceived speed measured using fi xed stimulus sets as reference scales while mean spatial frequency and bandwidths serve as the dependent variable in a probe. The presentations are short (200ms). Using a scale of narrowband stimuli (0.2 octaves), we measured a shift in perceived speed; higher frequencies are seen as faster moving than lower ones. On the scale of broader bandwidth (1 octave), this difference across frequency was reduced and perceived speed seems to converge on a slower representation. From these results we estimated this mapping between perceived and veridical stimulus speeds. In direct comparisons, the relative speed is faster for high frequencies and increases in bandwidth make stimuli appear slower. During this early computation, when presented with a random phase stimulus it appears that the visual systems makes assumptions about expected speeds based on the richness of the frequency content and the veridical speed is not explicitly computed. In this first 200ms, the perceptual system perhaps underestimates some speeds in an optimal response for initially stabilizing the scene. Acknowledgement: {CNRS} \& Brainscales {FP}7},

It is unclear how the spatiotemporal content of the fixated scene has an impact on the properties of miniatures, fixational eye movements. We have investigated the characteristics of fixational eye movements recorded while human subjects are instructed to fixate natural statistics random textures (Motion Clouds) in which we manipulated the spatial frequency content. We used long presentations (5 sec) of Motion Clouds stimuli (Schrater et al. 2000) of varying spatial frequency bandwidths (Bsf) around different central spatial frequency (Sf0). We found that central spatial frequency has an effect upon microsaccadic eye movements. In particular, smaller saccadic amplitudes were associated with high spatial frequencies, and larger saccades with low spatial frequencies. Broadening the spatial frequency bandwidth also changed the distribution of microsaccade amplitudes. A lower spatial frequencies, larger Bsf resulted in a large reduction of microsaccades amplitude while fixation behavior for high spatial frequencies texture was not affected. Relationship between microsaccade rate and intersaccadic timing was also dependent upon Bsf. These results suggest that the spatial frequency content of the fixated images have a strong impact upon fixation instability. Paul R. Schrater, David C. Knill and Eero P.

We based our model on the work of Van Rullen and Thorpe Neural Comput. 13 (6) (2001) 1255, which constructs a retinal representation using an orthogonal wavelet transform. This strategy provides a spike code, thanks to a rank order coding scheme which offers an alternative to the classical spike frequency coding scheme. We extended this model to efficient representations in arbitrary linear generative models by implementing lateral interactions on top of this feed-forward model. This method uses a matching pursuit scheme-recursively detecting in the image the best match with the elements of a dictionary and then subtracting it-and which may similarly define a visual spike code. In particular, this transform could be used with large and arbitrary dictionaries, so that we may define an over-complete representation which may define an efficient sparse spike coding scheme in arbitrary multi-layered architectures. We show here extensions of this method of computing with spike events, introducing an adaptive scheme leading to the emergence of V1-like receptive fields and then a model of bottom-up saliency pursuit. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {When generating a saccade toward a moving target, the target displacement that occurs during the period spanning from its detection to the saccade end must be taken into account to accurately foveate the target and to initiate its pursuit. Previous studies have shown that these saccades are characterized by a lower peak velocity and a prolonged deceleration phase. In some cases, a second peak eye velocity appears during the deceleration phase, presumably reflecting the late influence of a mechanism that compensates for the target displacement occurring before saccade end. The goal of this work was to further determine in the head restrained monkey the dynamics of this putative compensatory mechanism. A step-ramp paradigm, where the target motion was orthogonal to a target step occurring along the primary axes, was used to estimate from the generated saccades: a component induced by the target step and another one induced by the target motion. Resulting oblique saccades were compared with saccades to a static target with matched horizontal and vertical amplitudes. This study permitted to estimate the time taken for visual motion-related signals to update the programming and execution of saccades. The amplitude of the motion-related component was slightly hypometric with an undershoot that increased with target speed. Moreover, it matched with the eccentricity that the target had 40-60 ms before saccade end. The lack of significant difference in the delay between the onsets of the horizontal and vertical components between saccades directed toward a static target and those aimed at a moving target questions the late influence of the compensatory mechanism. The results are discussed within the framework of the "dual drive" and "remapping" hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Most studies on the dynamics of recurrent cortical networks are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood couplings. Neuronal cortical connectivity, however, shows a complex spatial pattern composed of local and remote patchy connections. We ask to what extent such geometric traits influence the "idle" dynamics of two-dimensional (2d) cortical network models composed of conductance-based integrate-and-fire (iaf) neurons. In contrast to the typical 1 mm(2) used in most studies, we employ an enlarged spatial set-up of 25 mm(2) to provide for long-range connections. Our models range from purely random to distance-dependent connectivities including patchy projections, i.e., spatially clustered synapses. Analyzing the characteristic measures for synchronicity and regularity in neuronal spiking, we explore and compare the phase spaces and activity patterns of our simulation results. Depending on the input parameters, different dynamical states appear, similar to the known synchronous regular "{SR}" or asynchronous irregular "{AI}" firing in random networks. Our structured networks, however, exhibit shifted and sharper transitions, as well as more complex activity patterns. Distance-dependent connectivity structures induce a spatio-temporal spread of activity, e.g., propagating waves, that random networks cannot account for. Spatially and temporally restricted activity injections reveal that a high amount of local coupling induces rather unstable {AI} dynamics. We find that the amount of local versus long-range connections is an important parameter, whereas the structurally advantageous wiring cost optimization of patchy networks has little bearing on the phase space.},

	abstract = {We study cortical network dynamics for a spatially embedded network model. It represents, in terms of spatial scale, a large piece of cortex allowing for long-range connections, resulting in a rather sparse connectivity. The spatial embedding also permits us to include distance-dependent conduction delays. We use two different types of conductance-based I\&F neurons as excitatory and inhibitory units, as well as specific connection probabilities. In order to remain computationally tractable, we reduce neuron density, modelling part of the missing internal input via external poissonian spike trains. Compared to previous studies, we observe significant changes in the dynamical phase space: Altered activity patterns require another regularity measures than the coefficient of variation. Hence, we compare three different regularity measure on the basis of artificial inter-spike-interval distributions. We identify two types of mixed states, where different phases coexist in certain regions of the phase space. More notably, our boundary between high and low activity states depends predominantly on the relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength instead of the input rate.},

	abstract = {Current studies of cortical network dynamics are usually based on purely random wiring. Generally, these studies are focused on a local scale, where about 10 percent of all possible connections are realized. Neuronal connections in the cortex, however, show a more complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range patchy connections. Here, we ask to what extent the assumption of such specific geometric traits influences the resulting dynamical behavior of network models. Analyzing the characteristic measures describing spiking neuronal networks (e.g., firing rate, coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient), we ascertain and compare the dynamical state spaces of different types of networks. To include long-range connections, we enlarge the spatial scale, resulting in a much sparser connectivity than what is usually assumed. Similar to previous studies, we can distinguish between different dynamical states (e.g., synchronous regular firing), depending on the external input rate and the numerical relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic weights. Yet, local couplings in such very sparsely connected networks seem to induce specific correlations and require another regularity measure than the coefficient of variation.},

	abstract = {In the primary visual cortex (V1), single cell responses to simple{\textbackslash}nvisual stimuli (gratings) are usually dense but with a high trial-by-trial{\textbackslash}nvariability. In contrast, when exposed to full field natural scenes,{\textbackslash}nthe firing patterns of these neurons are sparse but highly reproducible{\textbackslash}nover trials (Marre et al., 2005; Frégnac et al., 2006). It is{\textbackslash}nstill not understood how these two classes of stimuli can elicit{\textbackslash}nthese two distinct firing behaviours. A common model for simple-cell{\textbackslash}ncomputation in layer 4 is the “push-pull” circuitry (Troyer et{\textbackslash}nal. 1998). It accounts for the observed anti-phase behaviour between{\textbackslash}nexcitatory and inhibitory conductances in response to a driftingŋrating (Anderson et al., 2000; Monier et al., 2008), creating a{\textbackslash}nwide temporal integration window during which excitation is integrated{\textbackslash}nwithout the shunting or opponent effect of inhibition and allowed{\textbackslash}nto elicit multiple spikes. This is in contrast to recent results{\textbackslash}nfrom intracellular recordings in vivo during presentation of natural{\textbackslash}nscenes (Baudot et al., submitted). Here the excitatory and inhibitory{\textbackslash}nconductances were highly correlated, with inhibition lagging excitation{\textbackslash}nonly by few milliseconds (\${\textbackslash}sim\$6 ms). This small lag creates a narrow{\textbackslash}ntemporal integration window such that only synchronized excitatory{\textbackslash}ninputs can elicit a spike, similar to parallel observations in other{\textbackslash}ncortical sensory areas (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Okun and Lampl, 2008).{\textbackslash}{nTo} investigate the cellular and network mechanisms underlying these{\textbackslash}ntwo different correlation structures, we constructed a realistic{\textbackslash}nmodel of the V1 network using spiking neurons with conductance based{\textbackslash}nsynapses. We calibrated our model to fit the irregular ongoing activity{\textbackslash}npattern as well as in vivo conductance measurements during driftingŋrating stimulation and then extracted predicted responses to natural{\textbackslash}nscenes seen through eye-movements. Our simulations reproduced the{\textbackslash}nabove described experimental observation, together with anti-phase{\textbackslash}nbehaviour between excitation and inhibition during gratings and phase{\textbackslash}nlagged activation during natural scenes. In conclusion, the same{\textbackslash}ncortical network that shows dense and variable responses to gratings{\textbackslash}nexhibits sparse and precise spiking to natural scenes. Work is under{\textbackslash}nway to show to which extent this feature is specific for the feedforward{\textbackslash}nvs recurrent nature of the modelled circuit.},

As a first step, we will study the learning of a layer of realistic neurons in the particular case where the relevant messages are formed by temporally cor- related patterns, or synfire patterns. The model is a layer of Integrate-and-Fire ({IF}) neurons with synaptic current dynamics that adapts by minimizing a cost according to a gradient descent scheme. This leads to a rule similar to Spike-Time Dependent Hebbian Plasticity ({STDHP}). Our results show that the rule that we derive is biologically plausible and leads to the detection of the coherence in the input in an unsupervised way. An application to shape recognition is shown as an illustration.},

	abstract = {Neurons receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs whose temporal interplay determines the spiking behavior. On average, excitation and inhibition balance each other, such that spikes are elicited by fluctuations. In addition, it has been shown in vivo that excitation and inhibition are correlated, with inhibition lagging excitation only by few milliseconds (\${\textbackslash}sim\$6 ms), creating a small temporal integration window. This correlation structure could be induced by feed-forward inhibition ({FFI}), which has been shown to be present at many sites in the central nervous system. To characterize the functional properties of feed-forward inhibition, we constructed a simple circuit using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses and applied spike pulse packets with defined strength and width. We found that the small temporal integration window, induced by the {FFI}, changes the integrative properties of the neuron. Only transient stimuli could produce a response when the {FFI} was active, whereas without {FFI} the neuron responded to both steady and transient stimuli. In addition, the {FFI} increased the trial-by-trial precision.},
