The brain has to constantly adapt to changes in the environment,
for instance when a contextual probabilistic variable switched its state.
For an agent interacting with such an environment,
it is important to respond to such switches with the shortest delay.
However, this operation has in general to be done with noisy sensory inputs
and solely based on the information available at the present time.
Here, we tested the ability of humans observers to accurately anticipate,
with their eye movements,
a target's motion direction
throughout random sequences of rightward/leftward motion alternations,
with random-length contextual blocks of different biases in direction probability.
Experimental results were compared to
those of a probabilistic agent optimized
with respect to this switching model.
We found a better fit between
the behaviorally observed anticipatory response
with that of the probabilistic agent
compared to other models such as the leaky-integrator model.
Moreover, we could similarly fit
the level of confidence given by human observers
with that provided by the model and
draw a common marker for subject inter-variability,
titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation.
Such results provide evidence that
human observers may efficiently represent an anticipatory belief
along with its precision and
they support a novel approach to more generically test
human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.

%5. Cover Letter
%Submissions should be accompanied by a brief covering letter from the corresponding author including full postal address, telephone number and e-mail address. This letter should contain two (100-word or shorter) summaries: a concise paragraph to the editor indicating the scientific grounds why the paper should be considered for a topical, interdisciplinary journal rather than for a single-discipline or archival journal; and a separate, 100-word summary of the paper's appeal to a popular (non-scientific) audience.

Please consider this submission for publication in \Journal .

Understanding how humans make judgments from sensory information
is crucial for psychology, neuroscience
and computer vision.  Current theories for how we categorize images, e.g.,
determining whether it contains an animal, rely on hierarchical neural
processing involving much of the cerebral cortex, progressively
analyzing more complex features.  Here we show that such decisions can
be made with human-like accuracy using low-level statistical
regularities alone. Surprisingly, the required representation is
present already in early visual areas, before any hierarchical object
representation. Our results suggest that humans (and future artificial
systems) can use much simpler processing strategies than previously
assumed.

More importantly, we provide with a quantitative proof that such non-semantic information may help build a categorical decision. 
As such, we believe that this work presents a highly novel and significant finding of broad interest in psychology
which will have a influential impact on the readership of \Journal .
