The brain has to constantly adapt to changes in the environment,
for instance when a contextual probabilistic variable switched its state.
For an agent interacting with such an environment,
it is important to respond to such switches with the shortest delay.
However, this operation has in general to be done with noisy sensory inputs
and solely based on the information available at the present time.
Here, we tested the ability of humans observers to accurately anticipate,
with their eye movements,
a target's motion direction
throughout random sequences of rightward/leftward motion alternations,
with random-length contextual blocks of different biases in direction probability.
Experimental results were compared to
those of a probabilistic agent optimized
with respect to this switching model.
We found a better fit between
the behaviorally observed anticipatory response
with that of the probabilistic agent
compared to other models such as the leaky-integrator model.
Moreover, we could similarly fit
the level of confidence given by human observers
with that provided by the model and
draw a common marker for subject inter-variability,
titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation.
Such results provide evidence that
human observers may efficiently represent an anticipatory belief
along with its precision and
they support a novel approach to more generically test
human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.

Please consider this submission for publication in \Journal . This inter-displinary work studies how ``\emph{\Title}'' by defining a theoretically-driven experimental protocol which is then validated in different behavioral experiments.

Understanding how humans adapt to changing environments to make judgments or plan motor responses based on time-varying sensory information 
is indeed crucial for psychology, neuroscience
and artificial intelligence.  
Current theories for how we deal with the environment's uncertainty most rely on \emph{equilibrium} behavioral responses in experiments where some stationary randomness is introduced.  
Here we show that in the case where the context switches at random times during the experiment, an adaptation to the \emph{volatility} can be performed online.
In particular, we show in two behavioural experiments that humans can adapt to such volatility at the early sensorimotor level, through their anticipatory eye movements, but also at a higher cognitive level, through explicit ratings. 
Our results suggest that humans (and future artificial
systems) can use much richer adaptive strategies than previously
assumed.

Importantly, we provide in this work a full theoretical hierarchical Bayesian model for the study, which allows the rigorous analysis of the behavioral data and which we think will provide an essential tool to move forward the field. 
As such, we believe that this work presents a highly novel and significant finding of broad interest 
which will have an influential impact on the readership of \Journal .
