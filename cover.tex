\newcommand{\Abstract}{
The brain has to constantly adapt to changes in the environment,
for instance when a contextual probabilistic variable switched its state.
For an agent interacting with such an environment,
it is important to respond to such switches with the shortest delay.
However, this operation has in general to be done with noisy sensory inputs
and solely based on the information available at the present time.
Here, we tested the ability of humans observers to accurately anticipate,
with their eye movements,
a target's motion direction
throughout random sequences of rightward/leftward motion alternations,
with random-length contextual blocks of different biases in direction probability.
Experimental results were compared to
those of a probabilistic agent optimized
with respect to this switching model.
We found a better fit between
the behaviorally observed anticipatory response
with that of the probabilistic agent
compared to other models such as the leaky-integrator model.
Moreover, we could similarly fit
the level of confidence given by human observers
with that provided by the model and
draw a common marker for subject inter-variability,
titrating their level of preference between exploration and exploitation.
Such results provide evidence that
human observers may efficiently represent an anticipatory belief
along with its precision and
they support a novel approach to more generically test
human cognitive abilities in uncertain and dynamic environments.

%5. Cover Letter
%Submissions should be accompanied by a brief covering letter from the corresponding author including full postal address, telephone number and e-mail address. This letter should contain two (100-word or shorter) summaries: a concise paragraph to the editor indicating the scientific grounds why the paper should be considered for a topical, interdisciplinary journal rather than for a single-discipline or archival journal; and a separate, 100-word summary of the paper's appeal to a popular (non-scientific) audience.

Please consider our original manuscript ``{\it \Title }'' that we submit for publication in \Journal . All the authors have been involved with the work, have approved the manuscript and agreed to its submission.

Hereby, we submit our revised manuscript, entitled ``{\it \Title }'' ,  along  with  our  response  to  the  reviewers  and  corresponding  supplementary  information.  


% TO UPDATE = short description
The present study details the complete formulation of a generative
model of artificial textures intended to probe visual perception. It is first derived in a set of
axiomatic steps constrained by biological plausibility. We then extend previous contributions
by detailing three equivalent formulations of the Gaussian dynamic texture
model. Our model enables real-time on-the-fly texture synthesis using time-discretized autoregressive
processes. We use the model to probe speed perception in humans psychophysically using zoom-like changes
in stimulus spatial frequency content. The data replicates previous findings that relative perceived speed is positively biased by spatial
frequency increments. The effect cannot be fully accounted for by previous models,
but a parametric Bayesian model successfully accounts for the perceptual bias.

Our  response  to  the  reviewers  includes  the  point-by-point  responses  to  each  issue  raised  by  
both reviewers. The reviewers’ comments were helpful, and we feel that the manuscript is substantially improved.  
We have ensured that our manuscript complies with all formatting and editorial requirements.  


% AM: I think this section should go after the description of the science
% 'We ensure that n' - i think this is unnecessary, also 'a long version should be elaborated on below... '
None of the material has been published or is under consideration for
publication in other journals. This work constitutes a comprehensive extension to the conference paper referenced as \textit{Biologically Inspired Dynamic Textures for Probing Motion Perception.
J. Vacher, A.I. Meso, L.U. Perrinet, G. Peyr\'e -- Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015.}

% AM: I have also suggested some wording changes below... just minor ones, remove 'As such, ...' I also removed 'experimental' before neuroscience
We believe that this work presents a novel contribution of broad interest in neuroscience and psychophysics. We must stress that it combines the expertise in different fields for understanding neural computations: theoretical, computational and experimental. In addition, we demonstrate that a Bayesian model for vision is able to account for the effect of scene zooming, manipulated through spatial frequency on speed perception. We believe that these two contributions will be of significant interest to the readership of \Journal.


We  suggest  the  following  five  potential  review
ers.  All  of  them  are  the  experts  in  the  
relevant areas of our manuscript. 


Following the change to the competing interests policy, we have revised the our ‘Conflict of interest’ statement to the following: 
‘
Competing interests: The authors declare no competing interests’
Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to your response. 

We did not have any prior discussions with 
a \Journal Editorial Board Member 
about the work described in the manuscript. 

Thank you for your consideration.%, and I look forward to hearing whether this article can be sent out for review.


Sincerely, on behalf of all co-authors,
